## Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

**Understand**

You are given a sorted array nums and a target value target.
You must find the starting and ending position of target in the array.
If the target is not present, return [-1, -1].

Example:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]

Constraints:

0 <= len(nums) <= 10⁵

-10⁹ <= nums[i], target <= 10⁹

nums is non-decreasing.
