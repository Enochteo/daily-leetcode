## Apply Operations to an Array

**Understand**

You are given an integer array nums.
Perform the following operations in order:

For each index i, if nums[i] == nums[i + 1], then:

Double nums[i] (i.e., nums[i] \*= 2)

Set nums[i + 1] = 0

After processing all elements, move all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Return the final array.
