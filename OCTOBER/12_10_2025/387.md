## First Unique Character in a String

**Understand**

You are given a string s.
Your task is to find the index of the first non-repeating character in s.
If no unique character exists, return -1.

Example:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Explanation: 'l' appears once and is the first unique character.

**Match**

This is a string frequency analysis problem.

Use a hash map (or Counter) to store character frequencies.

Iterate through the string and return the first index where frequency = 1.

This approach ensures O(n) time complexity.

**Plan**

Use collections.Counter to count occurrences of each character in s.

Loop through indices i in the string:

If freq[s[i]] == 1, return i immediately.

If no unique character found, return -1.

**Implement**

```py
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        freq = Counter(s)
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if freq[s[i]] == 1:
                return i
        return -1
```

**Review**

Uses Counter for concise and efficient frequency mapping.

Two linear passes: one for counting, one for scanning.

Handles both small and large strings effectively.

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: O(n), where n = length of string.

Space Complexity: O(1), since alphabet size (26 lowercase letters) is constant.

**Pattern to remember**

For “first non-repeating character” problems:

Count character frequencies using a hash map or array.

Iterate once more to find the first character with frequency = 1.

Return its index or -1 if none found.
