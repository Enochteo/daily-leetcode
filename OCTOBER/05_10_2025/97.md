## Interleaving String

**Understand**
Given three strings s1, s2, s3, return whether or not the string s3 can be formed by interleaving the string s1 and s2. An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where s and t are divided into n and m substrings respectively, such that:

```
s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
|n - m| <= 1
The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...
Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.
```
