## Split Array Largest Sum

**Understand**

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
Split the array into k non-empty continuous subarrays, and return the minimum possible value of the largest subarray sum among all possible splits.

Example:

Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2
Output: 18
Explanation:

- Split into [7,2,5] and [10,8]
- Largest subarray sum = max(14,18) = 18 (minimum possible)

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: 9
Explanation:

- Split into [1,2,3,4] and [5] → max = 10
- Split into [1,2,3] and [4,5] → max = 9

Constraints:

1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000

0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁶

1 ≤ k ≤ nums.length

**Match**

This problem fits dynamic programming with recursion + memoization.
You are asked to partition an array into k contiguous groups minimizing the maximum subarray sum, a classic partition DP pattern.

Each recursive state defines:

Current starting index (index)

Remaining splits (k)

and tries all valid partitions to find the optimal one.
