## Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon

**Understand**

You are given an array values of length n, where values[i] represents the vertex value of a convex polygon.

You must triangulate the polygon into n - 2 triangles such that the sum of the triangle scores is minimized.

The score of each triangle is the product of its vertices' values.

Triangles can share edges and vertices.
