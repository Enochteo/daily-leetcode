## Spreadsheet Formula Evaluator (Custom Class Implementation)

**Understand**

We need to design a simplified spreadsheet system that can:

Store cell values.

Reset cell values.

Evaluate formulas of the form "=A1+B2" or "=2+3".

The spreadsheet uses a dictionary to store cell names (str) and their integer values.

Formulas can include either cell references or numeric constants, separated by '+'.
