## Spreadsheet Formula Evaluator (Custom Class Implementation)

**Understand**

We need to design a simplified spreadsheet system that can:

Store cell values.

Reset cell values.

Evaluate formulas of the form "=A1+B2" or "=2+3".

The spreadsheet uses a dictionary to store cell names (str) and their integer values.

Formulas can include either cell references or numeric constants, separated by '+'.

**Match**

This problem combines data structure design and basic string parsing.
We maintain a hash map (dictionary) to map cell names to values.
For formula evaluation, we:

Parse tokens separated by '+'.

Check if each token is numeric or a cell reference.

Sum up their resolved values.

**Plan**

Initialization

Use a dictionary self.sheets to store cell values.

setCell(cell, value)

Store value in self.sheets[cell].

resetCell(cell)

Set cell value back to 0.

getValue(formula)

Strip '=' from the start and split by '+'.

For each term:

If numeric, convert to int.

Else, look up its value in the sheet (default 0 if undefined).

Return their sum.
