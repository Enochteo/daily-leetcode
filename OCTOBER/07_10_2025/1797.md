## Design Authentication Manager

**Understand**

You must design an authentication manager that manages session tokens with a fixed Time-To-Live (TTL) value.

Each token expires timeToLive seconds after it’s generated or renewed.
The system supports three operations:

generate(tokenId, currentTime) → creates a new token valid until currentTime + TTL.

renew(tokenId, currentTime) → refreshes the token’s expiry if it’s still valid.

countUnexpiredTokens(currentTime) → returns how many tokens are still valid at currentTime.
