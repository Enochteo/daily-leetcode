## Maximum Length of Increasing Subarrays

**Understand**

You are given an integer array nums.
Find the maximum integer k such that there exist two consecutive non-overlapping increasing subarrays each of length at least k.

An increasing subarray means every consecutive element satisfies:

nums[i] < nums[i+1]

**Example**:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- Increasing subarrays: [1,2,3] and [2,3,4,5,6]
- Largest `k` where both consecutive increasing subarrays have at least length `k` = 3
```

**Edge Case Example**:

```
Input: nums = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
No increasing subarrays longer than 1 exist.
```
