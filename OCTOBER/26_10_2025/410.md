## Split Array Largest Sum

**Understand**

You have an array nums and an integer k.
You must split nums into k non-empty continuous subarrays so that the largest subarray sum is as small as possible.
Return that minimum possible largest sum.

Example 1

Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2
Output: 18
Explanation:
Split [7,2,5] and [10,8]
max(14,18) = 18 â†’ smallest achievable
