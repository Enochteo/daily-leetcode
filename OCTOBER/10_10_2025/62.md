## Unique Paths

**Understand**

You are given an m x n grid.
A robot starts at the top-left corner (0, 0) and can only move down or right at each step.
The goal is to reach the bottom-right corner (m - 1, n - 1).

Return the total number of unique paths possible.

**Match**

This is a combinatorial path counting or Dynamic Programming (DFS + memoization) problem.

Each cell (r, c) can move to (r+1, c) or (r, c+1).

The total paths from (r, c) = sum of paths from its right and bottom neighbors.

Use memoization to avoid recomputing overlapping subproblems.

Recursive relation:

dfs(r, c) = dfs(r + 1, c) + dfs(r, c + 1)
Base cases:

- If out of bounds → 0
- If at destination → 1
