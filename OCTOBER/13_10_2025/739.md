## Daily Temperatures

**Understand**

You are given a list of daily temperatures.
For each day, find how many days you have to wait until a warmer temperature.
If no warmer day exists, the answer is 0 for that day.

Example:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Explanation:

- Day 1 (73°F): Next warmer day after 1 day (74°F)
- Day 2 (74°F): Next warmer day after 1 day (75°F)
- Day 3 (75°F): Next warmer day after 4 days (76°F)
- Day 7 (73°F): No warmer day → 0

Constraints:

1 <= len(temperatures) <= 10⁵

Each temperature is between 30 and 100.

**Match**

This is a monotonic stack problem.
We need to efficiently find the next greater element (warmer temperature) for each day.
A stack of indices helps track temperatures in decreasing order — once we find a higher one, we know the next warmer day.
