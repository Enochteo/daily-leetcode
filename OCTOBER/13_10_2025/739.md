## Daily Temperatures

**Understand**

You are given a list of daily temperatures.
For each day, find how many days you have to wait until a warmer temperature.
If no warmer day exists, the answer is 0 for that day.

Example:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Explanation:

- Day 1 (73°F): Next warmer day after 1 day (74°F)
- Day 2 (74°F): Next warmer day after 1 day (75°F)
- Day 3 (75°F): Next warmer day after 4 days (76°F)
- Day 7 (73°F): No warmer day → 0

Constraints:

1 <= len(temperatures) <= 10⁵

Each temperature is between 30 and 100.

**Match**

This is a monotonic stack problem.
We need to efficiently find the next greater element (warmer temperature) for each day.
A stack of indices helps track temperatures in decreasing order — once we find a higher one, we know the next warmer day.

**Plan**

Initialize an array res of size n with zeros.

Initialize an empty stack (to store indices of unresolved days).

Iterate backward from the last day to the first:

While stack not empty and current temp ≥ temp[stack[-1]], pop from stack (since those days are colder or equal).

If stack not empty, res[i] = stack[-1] - i (distance to the next warmer day).

Push the current index i onto the stack.

Return the result array res.

**Implement**

```py
class Solution(object):
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures):
        """
        :type temperatures: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = [0] * len(temperatures)
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(temperatures) - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack and temperatures[stack[-1]] <= temperatures[i]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                res[i] = stack[-1] - i
            stack.append(i)
        return res
```

**Review**

Uses a monotonic decreasing stack to maintain indices of unprocessed days.

By iterating backward, future temperatures are already known.

Efficient O(n) solution avoiding nested loops.
