## Vowel Spellchecker

**Understand**

You are given two lists:

wordlist: valid dictionary words.

queries: list of words to check against the dictionary.

For each query, you must return the first matching word in wordlist that satisfies the following rules (in priority order):

Exact Match:

Query matches a word exactly (case-sensitive).

Case-Insensitive Match:

Query matches a word in wordlist when ignoring capitalization.

Vowel-Insensitive Match:

Query matches when vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are treated as interchangeable (replaced with \*).

If no match is found, return an empty string.

Example:

```
Input:
wordlist = ["KiTe","kite","hare","Hare"]
queries = ["kite","Kite","KiTe","Hare","HARE","Hear","hear","keti","keet","keto"]

Output:
["kite","KiTe","KiTe","Hare","hare","","","KiTe","","KiTe"]
```

**Match**

This is a string normalization and hash mapping problem.
We must support multiple matching tiers using hash lookups:

Tier 1: Exact match (case-sensitive).

Tier 2: Case-insensitive match.

Tier 3: Vowel-insensitive match (normalize vowels → \*).

Each tier is preprocessed using dictionaries for O(1) lookup per query.

**Plan**

Preprocess wordlist:

Store all words in a set for perfect matches.

Store the first occurrence of each lowercase word in words_cap.

Store the first occurrence of each vowel-normalized word in words_devoweled.

Define helper function devowel(word) → replaces all vowels with \*.

For each query:

Check 1: If query in perfect_match, return it.

Check 2: If lowercase(query) in words_cap, return corresponding word.

Check 3: If devowel(query) in words_devoweled, return corresponding word.

Otherwise, return "".

Collect all results in a list and return.

**Implement**

```py
class Solution:
    def spellchecker(self, wordlist: List[str], queries: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        perfect_match = set(wordlist)
        words_cap = {}
        words_devoweled = {}
        vowels = 'aeiou'

        def devowel(word):
            return ''.join(['*' if c in vowels else c for c in word.lower()])

        for w in wordlist:
            if w.lower() not in words_cap:
                words_cap[w.lower()] = w
            if devowel(w) not in words_devoweled:
                words_devoweled[devowel(w)] = w

        def first_check(word):
            if word in perfect_match:
                return word

        def second_check(word):
            if word.lower() in words_cap:
                return words_cap[word.lower()]

        def third_check(word):
            if devowel(word) in words_devoweled:
                return words_devoweled[devowel(word)]

        res = []
        for q in queries:
            first_try = first_check(q)
            second_try = second_check(q)
            third_try = third_check(q)
            if first_try is not None:
                res.append(first_try)
            elif second_try is not None:
                res.append(second_try)
            else:
                res.append(third_try if third_try else "")
        return res
```
