## Vowel Spellchecker

**Understand**

You are given two lists:

wordlist: valid dictionary words.

queries: list of words to check against the dictionary.

For each query, you must return the first matching word in wordlist that satisfies the following rules (in priority order):

Exact Match:

Query matches a word exactly (case-sensitive).

Case-Insensitive Match:

Query matches a word in wordlist when ignoring capitalization.

Vowel-Insensitive Match:

Query matches when vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are treated as interchangeable (replaced with \*).

If no match is found, return an empty string.

Example:

```
Input:
wordlist = ["KiTe","kite","hare","Hare"]
queries = ["kite","Kite","KiTe","Hare","HARE","Hear","hear","keti","keet","keto"]

Output:
["kite","KiTe","KiTe","Hare","hare","","","KiTe","","KiTe"]
```

**Match**

This is a string normalization and hash mapping problem.
We must support multiple matching tiers using hash lookups:

Tier 1: Exact match (case-sensitive).

Tier 2: Case-insensitive match.

Tier 3: Vowel-insensitive match (normalize vowels â†’ \*).

Each tier is preprocessed using dictionaries for O(1) lookup per query.
