## Linked List in Binary Tree

**Understand**

We are given:

A linked list head.

A binary tree root.

We must determine if the linked list is a downward path in the binary tree.

The path must start at some tree node.

The path must follow left/right child pointers.

Each tree node must match the corresponding list node.

```
Example:

Input: head = [4,2,8], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
Output: True
Explanation: Linked list [4,2,8] exists as a downward path in the tree.
```

Constraints:

Length of linked list: 1 <= n <= 100

Nodes in binary tree: 1 <= m <= 2500

**Match**

This is a tree + linked list pattern matching problem.

Use DFS to try every tree node as a potential starting point.

When values match, recursively check if the linked list continues down that subtree.

Otherwise, keep searching left and right.
