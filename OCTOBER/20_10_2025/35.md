## Search Insert Position

**Understand**

Given a sorted array nums and an integer target, return the index where the target is found,
or the index where it would be inserted in order if not present.

Example:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

Constraints:

1 <= len(nums) <= 10⁴

-10⁴ <= nums[i], target <= 10⁴

nums is sorted in ascending order.

**Match**

This is a binary search problem — you need to either find the target or locate its correct insertion position in a sorted list.
Binary search efficiently narrows down the possible index range in O(log n) time.
