**Understand**

You are a professional thief planning to rob houses along a street.
Each house has a certain amount of money, represented by nums[i].
You cannot rob two adjacent houses because of security alarms.

Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.

Example:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Rob house 1 (money = 1) and house 3 (money = 3) â†’ total = 4
```
