## 3Sum

**Understand**

You are given an integer array nums.
Return all unique triplets [a, b, c] in the array such that:

a + b + c == 0

Triplets should not contain duplicates and can appear in any order.

Example:

Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
Explanation:

- (-1, -1, 2) → sum = 0
- (-1, 0, 1) → sum = 0

**Match**

This is a two-pointer search problem on a sorted array — a classic variant of 3Sum.
By sorting and fixing one number at a time, we can reduce the problem to a 2Sum search on the remainder of the array using two pointers (l and r).
