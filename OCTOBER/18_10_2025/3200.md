## Find Increasing Subarrays

**Understand**

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
Return True if there exist two consecutive non-overlapping increasing subarrays, each of length k.
Otherwise, return False.

Each increasing subarray must satisfy:

nums[i] < nums[i + 1] < ... < nums[i + k - 1]

and the second subarray must immediately follow the first one.

Example:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9], k = 3
Output: True
Explanation:
Two consecutive increasing subarrays of length 3 are:
[1,2,3] and [5,6,7]

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: False
Explanation:
There are increasing pairs, but none are consecutive non-overlapping segments of equal length.

**Match**

This is a subarray pattern detection problem using window checking.
We need to scan the array and check, for every starting index i, whether both segments [i:i+k] and [i+k:i+2k] are strictly increasing.
