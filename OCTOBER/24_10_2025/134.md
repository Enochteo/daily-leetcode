## Gas Station

**Understand**

You are given two integer arrays:

gas[i] — the amount of gas available at station i

cost[i] — the gas cost to travel from station i to (i + 1)

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank.
You start with 0 gas at some station and can move only clockwise.

Find the starting station index from which you can travel around the circuit once and return to the same station.
If it’s not possible, return -1.

**Example**:

Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3:

- tank = 0 + (4 - 1) = 3
- tank = 3 + (5 - 2) = 6
- tank = 6 + (1 - 3) = 4
- tank = 4 + (2 - 4) = 2
- tank = 2 + (3 - 5) = 0 (successfully returns)

Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1

**Match**

This is a greedy problem.
We want to find a valid starting index that allows completing the full circuit.

Observation:

If the total gas < total cost, no valid solution exists.

If total gas ≥ total cost, there must be at least one valid start.

Whenever your running tank becomes negative, any station before that cannot be the valid start — restart from the next one.
