## Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums

**Understand**

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, find the k pairs (u, v) with the smallest sums, where u comes from nums1 and v from nums2.

Example:

Input: nums1 = [1,7,11], nums2 = [2,4,6], k = 3  
Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]]

Explanation:
All pairs sorted by sum are:
[1,2], [1,4], [1,6], [7,2], [7,4], [11,2], …
The first 3 pairs have the smallest sums.

**Match**

This is a heap / k-way merge pattern — similar to merging sorted lists.
Because both arrays are sorted ascending, the smallest pairs start from (nums1[0], nums2[0]) and can be expanded systematically.

We can use a min-heap storing (sum, i, j) indices representing the pair (nums1[i], nums2[j]).
