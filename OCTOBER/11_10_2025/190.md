## Reverse Bits

**Understand**

You are given a 32-bit unsigned integer n.
Your task is to reverse the bits of n and return the resulting integer.

Example:

```
Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output:    964176192
Explanation: Reversed bits = 00111001011110000010100101000000
```

**Match**

This is a bit manipulation problem.
We process each bit in n from least significant bit (LSB) to most significant bit (MSB),
and build the reversed result by shifting bits accordingly.
