## Add Bold Tag in String

**Understand**

You are given a string s and a list of words words.
You need to insert the tag <b> and </b> around every substring in s that appears in words.
If multiple bold ranges overlap or are adjacent, merge them into a single <b>...</b> block.

Example:

Input: s = "abcxyz123", words = ["abc","123"]
Output: "<b>abc</b>xyz<b>123</b>"

Input: s = "aaabbcc", words = ["aaa","aab","bc"]
Output: "<b>aaabbc</b>c"
