## Add Bold Tag in String

**Understand**

You are given a string s and a list of words words.
You need to insert the tag <b> and </b> around every substring in s that appears in words.
If multiple bold ranges overlap or are adjacent, merge them into a single <b>...</b> block.

Example:

Input: s = "abcxyz123", words = ["abc","123"]
Output: "<b>abc</b>xyz<b>123</b>"

Input: s = "aaabbcc", words = ["aaa","aab","bc"]
Output: "<b>aaabbc</b>c"

**Match**

This is a string processing problem that combines pattern matching with interval merging.
A Trie structure is efficient for checking substrings starting from each index of s.
Once we mark all matching indices as bold, we can build the final string by inserting tags accordingly.
