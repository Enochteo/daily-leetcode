## Longest Palindromic Subsequence

**Understand**

We are given a string s.
We must return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in s.

A subsequence does not need to be contiguous, but must preserve relative order.

**Example**:

```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: Longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: Longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```

**Match**

This is a Dynamic Programming problem on substrings.
We can use DFS + memoization to avoid recomputing overlapping subproblems.

Key observations:

If s[l] == s[r], they can both be part of the palindrome.

Otherwise, we try skipping one end and take the max.

**Recursive relation**:

```
dfs(l, r) =
    0                     if l > r
    1                     if l == r
    2 + dfs(l+1, r-1)     if s[l] == s[r]
    max(dfs(l+1, r), dfs(l, r-1)) otherwise
```

**Plan**

Define dfs(l, r) â†’ length of LPS (Longest Palindromic Subsequence) in substring s[l:r+1].

Base cases:

If l > r: return 0.

If l == r: return 1.

Use memoization for (l, r) to store results.

Recursive transitions:

If s[l] == s[r]: 2 + dfs(l+1, r-1)

Else: max(dfs(l+1, r), dfs(l, r-1))

Return dfs(0, len(s) - 1).
