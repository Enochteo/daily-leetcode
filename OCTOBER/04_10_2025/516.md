## Longest Palindromic Subsequence

**Understand**

We are given a string s.
We must return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in s.

A subsequence does not need to be contiguous, but must preserve relative order.

**Example**:

```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: Longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: Longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```
