## Coin Change

**Understand**

We are given an array coins representing coin denominations and an integer amount.

We must return the fewest number of coins needed to make up that amount.
If itâ€™s not possible, return -1.

```
Example:

Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

**Constraints**:

````
1 <= coins.length <= 12

1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1

0 <= amount <= 10^4```
````
