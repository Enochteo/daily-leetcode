## Perfect Squares

**Understand**

We are given an integer n.

We must find the minimum number of perfect square numbers (like 1, 4, 9, â€¦) that sum to n.

```
Example:

Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4

Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9
```

**Match**

This is a Dynamic Programming problem (unbounded knapsack style).

dp[i] = minimum number of perfect squares summing to i.

Transition:

dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - j^2]) for all j^2 <= i
