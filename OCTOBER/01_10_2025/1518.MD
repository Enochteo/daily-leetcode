## Water Bottles

**Understand**

You have numBottles full water bottles. Every time you drink a bottle, you gain an empty bottle.

With numExchange empty bottles, you can exchange them for 1 full bottle.

We must calculate the maximum number of bottles you can drink.

Example:

Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: Drink 9, exchange 9 empties → 3 full → drink 3 → exchange 3 empties → 1 full → drink 1.

Constraints:

1 <= numBottles <= 100

2 <= numExchange <= 100

**Match**

This is a greedy simulation problem.

Always exchange empties when possible.

Process continues until empties < numExchange.
