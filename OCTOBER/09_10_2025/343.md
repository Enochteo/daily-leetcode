## Integer Break

**Understand**

You are given an integer n.
You must break it into the sum of at least two positive integers, and maximize the product of those integers.

Return the maximum product achievable.

**Match**

This is a Dynamic Programming / DFS with memoization problem.
We recursively break down n into smaller subproblems:

For each possible split i + (n - i), we choose the one giving the maximum product.

Each split can either stop (take i and n - i as is) or continue breaking further.

Recursive structure:

dfs(num) = max(i _ (num - i), dfs(i) _ dfs(num - i)) for i in 1..num-1

We use memoization (@lru_cache) to avoid recomputation.
