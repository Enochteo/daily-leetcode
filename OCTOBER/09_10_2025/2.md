## Add Two Numbers

**Understand**

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit.

You must add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list (also in reverse order).

**Match**

This is a linked list traversal + digit-by-digit addition problem.

Traverse both lists simultaneously.

Keep track of carry from previous addition.

Build a new list to represent the sum.

**Plan**

Initialize a dummy node and a pointer prev for building the result.

Initialize carry = 0.

Traverse while both l1 and l2 exist:

Compute cur_sum = l1.val + l2.val + carry.

Create a new node with value cur_sum % 10.

Update carry = cur_sum // 10.

If one list ends, continue adding remaining nodes plus any carry.

If carry remains after both lists are processed, append a final node.

Return dummy.next.
