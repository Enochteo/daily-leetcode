## Combination Sum

**Understand**

You are given an array of distinct positive integers candidates and an integer target.
Return a list of all unique combinations where the chosen numbers sum to target.
You may use the same number multiple times.
Combinations can be returned in any order.

Example:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:

- 2 + 2 + 3 = 7
- 7 = 7

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

Constraints:

1 <= candidates.length <= 30

2 <= candidates[i] <= 40

1 <= target <= 40

All numbers are distinct.
