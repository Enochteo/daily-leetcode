## Find Median from Data Stream

**Understand**

We need a data structure that supports:

addNum(num) → add a new number to the data stream

findMedian() → return the median of all elements so far

The median is:

Middle element if total count is odd.

Average of two middle elements if total count is even.

Example:

Input:
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]

Output:
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

**Match**

This is a streaming median problem.
We need to efficiently insert numbers and maintain quick access to the middle element.

Key idea:
Use two heaps:

Max-heap (less) → stores the smaller half of numbers (invert sign to simulate max-heap in Python).

Min-heap (greater) → stores the larger half of numbers.

Balance them so that their sizes differ by at most 1.
