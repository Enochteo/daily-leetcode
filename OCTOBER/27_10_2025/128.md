## Longest Consecutive Sequence

**Understand**

You are given an unsorted array of integers nums.
Return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

The solution must run in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

**Match**

We need a way to find consecutive numbers efficiently without sorting.
Sorting would be O(n log n), so instead use a hash set for O(1) lookups.

Pattern:

Convert to a set for constant-time membership checks.

Only start counting when num - 1 is not in the set → ensures each sequence is counted once.

Expand forward (num + 1, num + 2, …) until the sequence breaks.
