## All Possible Full Binary Trees

**Understand**

You are given an integer n, representing the number of nodes.
Your task is to return all possible full binary trees (FBTs) with n nodes.

A full binary tree is a tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children.

Each nodeâ€™s value is 0.
Return the list of all possible FBT roots.

**Example**:

Input: n = 7
Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0], [0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0]]
Explanation: There are two possible full binary trees with 7 nodes.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 20
