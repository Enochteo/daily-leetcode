## Battleships in a Board

**Understand**

You are given a 2D board where each cell is either 'X' (part of a battleship) or '.' (empty).

A battleship is represented by contiguous 'X' cells arranged horizontally or vertically, and there are no adjacent ships (ships are separated by at least one cell of '.').

Your task is to count how many distinct battleships are present on the board.

Example:

Input:

```
X..X
...X
...X
Output: 2
Explanation:
There are two battleships:
- One vertical ship at column 0
- One horizontal ship starting at (0, 3)
```

**Match**

This is a grid traversal and connected components counting problem, similar to counting islands.

Each battleship is a connected group of 'X' cells aligned horizontally or vertically.
We can use DFS to mark all parts of a ship once we find its start, preventing duplicate counting.

**Plan**

Get the grid dimensions ROWS and COLS.

Maintain a visited set to avoid recounting cells.

Define two DFS functions:

horizontal_dfs(r, c): Marks all connected 'X' cells vertically downward.

vertical_dfs(r, c): Marks all connected 'X' cells horizontally rightward.

Iterate through each cell (r, c) in the grid:

If it contains 'X' and hasnâ€™t been visited, increment battle_ships count.

From that cell, run both DFS functions to mark the full ship.

Return the total count.
