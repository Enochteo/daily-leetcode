## Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II

**Understand**

You are given a string s and an integer k.
You must repeatedly remove k adjacent duplicate characters until no more such groups exist.

Example:

````
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation:
- Remove "eee" → "ddbbcccbdaa"
- Remove "ccc" → "ddbbbdaa"
- Remove "bbb" → "dddaa"
- Remove "ddd" → "aa"
```
````

**Match**

This is a stack-based problem that tracks character frequencies.

Each stack entry holds (char, count) representing consecutive duplicates.

If count == k, that run is removed.

Efficiently simulates cascading removals in one pass.

**Plan**

Initialize an empty stack.

For each character c in s:

If stack not empty and top character equals c:

Increment its count.

If new count equals k, pop it (remove k duplicates).

Else, push (c, 1) onto stack.

Rebuild final string from remaining (char, count) pairs.
