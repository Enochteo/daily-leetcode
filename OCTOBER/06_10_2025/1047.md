## Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String

**Understand**

You are given a string s.

You must repeatedly remove pairs of adjacent duplicate characters until no such pairs remain.

```
Example:

Input: s = "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation:
- Remove "bb" → "aaca"
- Remove "aa" → "ca"
```

**Constraints**:

```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
```

s consists of lowercase English letters.

**Match**

This is a stack-based string manipulation problem.

Adjacent duplicates are local operations → ideal for a stack.

When a new character matches the top of the stack, both are removed.

Otherwise, push it onto the stack.
