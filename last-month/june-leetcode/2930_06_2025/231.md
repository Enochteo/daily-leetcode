## Power of Two
This problem checks whether a given integer n is a power of two. A number is a power of two if it can be written as 2^x for some integer x ≥ 0.

**Understand**
We are given an integer n. We need to return True if n is a power of two, and False otherwise

**Match**
This problem fits under:

- Math

- Bit manipulation

- Loop simulation

- Recursion

**Plan**
Three valid approaches:

Bit Manipulation Approach:

Any power of two has only one bit set in its binary representation (e.g. 2: 10, 4: 100).

If n > 0 and n & (n - 1) == 0, then it is a power of two.

Recursive Approach:

Repeatedly divide n by 2 and check if we reach exactly 1.

Base case: If n == 1, return True; if n < 1, return False.

Iterative Approach:

While n >= 2, divide n by 2.

After the loop, return whether n equals 1.

**Implement**
Bit Manipulation
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n):
        return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0
```
Recursive
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n):
        if n == 1:
            return True
        if n < 1:
            return False
        return self.isPowerOfTwo(n / 2.0)
```
Iterative
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n):
        while n >= 2:
            n = n / 2.0
        return n == 1
```

**Review**
The bit manipulation solution is the most efficient and avoids division altogether.

The recursive and iterative methods are easy to understand but may introduce float precision issues for large inputs.

All solutions return accurate results for valid integers.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity:

All methods: O(1) in worst-case logic steps due to bounded operations (maximum 31–32 for 32-bit int)

Space Complexity:

Bit manipulation and iterative: O(1)

Recursive: O(log n) due to call stack usage
