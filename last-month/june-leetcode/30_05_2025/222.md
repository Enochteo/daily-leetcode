## Count Complete Tree Nodes
First I tried traversing the whole tree.
Then i found out about the binary formula for binary trees

if the left depth and right depth are equal to get the total count:
    (2 ** left depth) + recursive_call(node.right)
if they are not
(2 ** right depth) + recursive_call(node.right)

to get both depths you run a dfs on either the left or right respectively

This involved bit manipulation and was not really in my scope of pareto problems but it was fun to learn and add to my knowledge.
