## Intersection of Two Arrays
Just a test of data structures.
I used a set for the results. I then iterated over the second list and if it was in the first. I added it to the set and returned the set.

But checking an array using "in" is O(n) so to optimize, I could just initially make the first array a set (O(1) search)
