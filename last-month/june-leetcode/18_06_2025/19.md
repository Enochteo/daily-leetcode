## Problem: Remove Nth Node From End of List
**Understand**
Given a singly linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return its head.
Extra info:
- The list contains at least 1 node.

- The value of n is always valid (1 ≤ n ≤ list length).

- You must maintain the original order of the list.


**Match**
This problem fits classic linked list pointer manipulation and is often solved with either:

Two-pass approach: Find the length first, then locate the node.
One-pass with two pointers: Keep a gap of n between fast and slow pointers.

This solution uses the two-pass method:

Count total number of nodes.

Use that count to find and skip the target node.


**Plan**
Traverse the list to count the number of nodes.

If n == total, it means we remove the first node — handle this case directly.

Start a second traversal from the head.

When you reach the node just before the one to delete, update its next pointer to skip the target node.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        last_node = head
        no_of_nodes = 0
        while last_node:
            no_of_nodes += 1
            last_node = last_node.next
        start_node = head
        if n == no_of_nodes:
            tmp = start_node.next
            start_node.next = None
            return tmp
        while start_node:
            if no_of_nodes == n+1:
                start_node.next = start_node.next.next
            no_of_nodes -= 1
            start_node = start_node.next
        return head
```

**Review**
Test Case 1:
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 2
Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Test Case 2:
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Test Case 3:
Input: head = [1, 2], n = 2
Output: [2]

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(L) where L is the length of the list (two passes).

Space Complexity: O(1) (no extra data structures used).

Strengths: Simple and intuitive to implement.

Weakness: Not as efficient as a one-pass method in interview scenarios.
