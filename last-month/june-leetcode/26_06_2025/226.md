## Invert Binary Tree
**Understand**
You are given the root of a binary tree.
Your task is to invert the tree, which means swapping the left and right children of every node.

Example:

```makefile
Input:
     4
    / \
   2   7
  / \ / \
 1  3 6  9

Output:
     4
    / \
   7   2
  / \ / \
 9  6 3  1
```
**Match**
This is a Binary Tree Traversal problem.
It uses recursion to traverse and swap the child nodes of each subtree.

**Plan**
If the current node is None, return None.

Recursively call the function on the left and right subtrees.

Swap the left and right child pointers of the current node.

Return the current node after swapping.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def invertTree(self, root):
        if not root:
            return
        if not root.left and not root.right:
            return root
        left = self.invertTree(root.left)
        right = self.invertTree(root.right)
        root.right = left
        root.left = right
        return root
```

**Review**
Properly uses recursion to traverse the tree

Swaps the child nodes for each node in postorder fashion

Base case correctly handles None and leaf nodes

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree

Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to recursion stack
