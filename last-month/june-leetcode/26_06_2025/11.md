## Container With Most Water
**Understand**
You are given a list height where each element represents the height of a vertical line drawn on the x-axis.
You must find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container holds the maximum amount of water.

Example:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The lines at index 1 and 8 form the container with the most water: min(8, 7) * (8 - 1) = 49

**Match**
This is a Two-Pointer problem.
The idea is to maximize area while reducing the width between the pointers only when it could lead to a taller height, which may produce a larger area.

**Plan**
Initialize two pointers:

l at the start of the list

r at the end of the list

Initialize max_area to 0

While l < r:

Calculate area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)

If this area is greater than max_area, update max_area

Move the pointer pointing to the shorter height inward, because a taller height could improve area

Return the max_area found

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        l = 0
        r = len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        while l < r:
            area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)
            if area > max_area:
                max_area = area
            if height[l] <= height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        return max_area
```

**Review**
Uses two-pointer approach efficiently

Avoids unnecessary comparisons by always moving the shorter wall

Correctly handles edge cases like short lists and equal heights

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of heights

Space Complexity: O(1), uses only constant extra space
