## Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array
**Understand**:
The problem is to return the maximum value for (nums[i]-1)*(nums[j]-1) for i and j in the array.
Input: The input is an array of numbers.

**Match**:
The problem involves array and sorting.
Optimizing the solution would involve an heap.

**Plan**:
- Find the maximum product of two elements in the array and return the product after subtracting one from each value

**Implement**:
- Initialize the first and second max to negative infinity(max1 and max2).
- Iterate over the list, when you get the first max, set max2 to max1 and update the next max.
- return the product of each value less 1.b
