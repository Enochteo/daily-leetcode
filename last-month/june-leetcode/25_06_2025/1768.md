## Merge Strings Alternately
**Understand**
You are given two strings, word1 and word2.
You need to merge them by alternating characters from each string.
If one string is longer than the other, append the remaining characters to the end of the merged string.

Example:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"

**Match**
This is a two-pointer traversal problem where you process two strings in parallel and interleave their characters.
The structure involves:

Merging characters one-by-one

Continuing with the leftover characters if lengths differ

**Plan**
Initialize an empty string merged to store the result.

Use two pointers first and second to iterate through word1 and word2.

While both pointers are within range:

Append word1[first] and word2[second] to merged

Increment both pointers

If word1 has leftover characters, append them.

If word2 has leftover characters, append them.

Return the merged result.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        merged = ""
        first = second = 0
        while (first <= len(word1)-1) and (second <= len(word2)-1):
            merged += word1[first]
            merged += word2[second]
            first += 1
            second += 1
        while first <= len(word1)-1:
            merged += word1[first]
            first += 1
        while second <= len(word2)-1:
            merged += word2[second]
            second += 1   
        return merged
```
**Review**
Correctly merges characters alternately

Handles leftover characters from either string

Works for unequal string lengths

Uses clear pointer logic and condition checks

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are lengths of word1 and word2

Space Complexity: O(n + m), for the merged result
