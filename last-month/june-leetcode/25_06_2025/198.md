**House Robber Problem** 
**Understand**
You are given an array of non-negative integers, where each number represents the amount of money in a house.
You are a robber and cannot rob two adjacent houses.
Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.

**Example**:
Input: `nums = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]`
Output: `12`
Explanation: Rob houses 2 and 4 (2 + 9 + 1 = 12)

**Match**
This is a Dynamic Programming problem.
It follows the "Choose or Skip" pattern:

At each house, you either rob it (and skip the previous) or skip it and take the best value so far.

**Plan**
Use a dp array where:

dp[i] stores the maximum money that can be robbed up to house i.

For each house:

Either take the current house + dp[i-2]

Or skip it and take dp[i-1]

Take the maximum of these two options.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return nums[0] if nums else 0

        dp = [0] * len(nums)

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i == 0:
                dp[i] = nums[0]
            elif i == 1:
                dp[i] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
            else:
                dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])

        return dp[-1]
```
**Review**
Tested on small and large inputs

Handles edge cases

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) (can be optimized to O(1) with two variables)
