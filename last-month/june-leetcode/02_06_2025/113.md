### Path Sum II * 
Understand:
The question is a continuation of Path Sum I, but instead of returning a boolean, we return a list of all root to leaf paths with targetSum.

Match:
The question is a binary tree question and has to do with Depth First Search. I used pre-order traversal.

Plan:
the plan is to generate each node path and if we get one with a sum of TargetSum we add to a list.

Implement:
- Initialize a list
- Do a depth first search:
    for each search pass an empth path, append each value to the path until you get a leaf, once you get to the leaf check if the sum equals target sum and if yes append to the list
- Backtrack by using pop at the end of the left and right recursive calls.

Evaluate:
Time Complexity - O(N)
Space Complexity - O(H) H is the number of valid paths, worst case - O(N)
