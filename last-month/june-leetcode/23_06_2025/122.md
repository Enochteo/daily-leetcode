## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
This project solves the problem of maximizing profit by making as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy and sell multiple times) given a list of daily stock prices. The idea is to capture all upward price movements.

**Understand**
You're given a list prices, where prices[i] is the price of a stock on day i. You may complete as many buy-sell transactions as you want â€” but you must sell the stock before you buy again.

 Goal: Maximize total profit.


**Example**:
```makefile
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy at 1, sell at 5 (profit = 4), then buy at 3, sell at 6 (profit = 3)
Total = 7
```

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

Greedy algorithms

Array traversal

Profit maximization by exploiting all ascending sequences

**Plan**
We can treat every upward slope as an opportunity:

Iterate through the array from day 1

If today's price is greater than yesterday's, add the profit

Do not track actual transactions, just accumulate profit

This is equivalent to summing all increases in the array.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                profit += (prices[i] - prices[i-1])
        return profit
```

**Review**
Greedily captures every profit opportunity

Simple and efficient

No need to simulate actual buys/sells

Handles all valid price arrays

**Evaluate**
Metric	Value
Time Complexity	O(n)
Space Complexity	O(1)
Handles All Cases	Yes
Requires Sorting?	No

**Examples**
```python
Input:  [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1, sell on day 5.

Input:  [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: No profit can be made.
