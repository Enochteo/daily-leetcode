## Majority Element II
Majority Element II (n/3 Voting Algorithm)
This project solves the Majority Element II problem, where the goal is to find all elements in an array that appear more than ⌊n / 3⌋ times. The solution uses the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, optimized for this frequency threshold with constant space and linear time.

**Understand**
You're given an integer array nums. Return all elements that appear more than ⌊n / 3⌋ times.

**Key Insight**:

At most two majority elements can exist in the array with this constraint, since:

More than ⌊n/3⌋ means each one must take up at least 33% of the array

You can only fit at most 2 such elements into 100%

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

Voting algorithm

State tracking with counters

Two-pass optimization

Similar to the "Majority Element I" problem, but generalized for n/3


**Plan**
```python
# 1. Initialize two majority candidate variables and two counters
# 2. First pass:
#    - For each number:
#      - If it's equal to one of the majority candidates, increment that counter
#      - If a counter is zero, adopt the new number as candidate
#      - Else, decrement both counters
# 3. Second pass:
#    - Reset both counters to 0
#    - Count actual occurrences of both majority candidates
# 4. If count of a candidate > n // 3, add it to the result
```

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        nums.sort()
        majority1 = majority2 = count1 = count2 = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num == majority1:
                count1 += 1
            elif num == majority2:
                count2 += 1
            elif count1 == 0:
                majority1 = num
                count1 += 1
            elif count2 == 0:
                majority2 = num
                count2 += 1
            else:
                count1 -= 1
                count2 -= 1
        
        # Verify the actual counts
        count1 = count2 = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num == majority1:
                count1 += 1
            elif num == majority2:
                count2 += 1
        
        if count1 > len(nums) // 3:
            res.append(majority1)
        if count2 > len(nums) // 3:
            res.append(majority2)

        return res
```
**Review**
 First pass: Select potential candidates

 Second pass: Validate actual frequencies
