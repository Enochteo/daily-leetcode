## Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
This project solves the problem of finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using a single-pass recursive solution. The approach leverages the properties of BSTs to efficiently determine the LCA.

**Understand**
You are given the root of a Binary Search Tree and two nodes p and q. You must return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

In a BST:

The left subtree of a node contains values less than the node's value.

The right subtree contains values greater than the node's value.

The LCA is the lowest node in the tree that has both p and q as descendants (a node can be a descendant of itself).

**Match**
This problem matches the following patterns:

Binary Search Tree traversal

Recursive tree processing

Decision-based traversal using value comparisons

It leverages the BST's sorted structure to eliminate unnecessary paths.

**Plan**
If the current root is None, return None.

If both p and q are less than the root, the LCA is in the left subtree.

If both p and q are greater than the root, the LCA is in the right subtree.

Otherwise, the current root is the split point and is the lowest common ancestor.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if not root:
            return

        if root.val < p.val and root.val < q.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        elif root.val > p.val and root.val > q.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        else:
            return root
```

**Review**
Uses BST properties to avoid visiting all nodes.

Each recursive call narrows down the search path.

Handles edge cases where one node is an ancestor of the other.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

O(log n) for balanced trees.

O(n) for skewed trees.

Space Complexity: O(h) due to recursion stack.
