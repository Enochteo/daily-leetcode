## Level Order Traversal of a Binary Tree
This project performs a level order traversal (also known as Breadth-First Search) of a binary tree and returns the values of nodes at each level as a list of lists. The solution uses a queue-based approach and follows the UMPIRE framework.

**Understand**
Given the root of a binary tree, return its level order traversal—that is, the node values at each level from top to bottom, left to right.

For example, given this tree:

```markdown
       3
      / \
     9  20
        / \
       15  7
```
The output should be: [[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]


Match
This problem matches the following patterns:

Tree traversal

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Queue usage to manage traversal order by level

Data structure used: Queue (deque)
Traversal type: Level Order

**Plan**
Check if the root is None. If so, return an empty list.

Initialize a queue with the root node.

While the queue is not empty:

Create a list to hold the current level’s values.

For each node in the queue at the current level:

Pop it from the queue.

Add its value to the level list.

Add its children to the queue.

Append the level list to the result.

Return the result list.

**Implement**
```python
from collections import deque

class Solution(object):
    def levelOrder(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        if not root:
            return []

        res = []
        queue = deque([root])

        while queue:
            level = []
            for i in range(len(queue)):
                curr = queue.popleft()
                level.append(curr.val)
                if curr.left:
                    queue.append(curr.left)
                if curr.right:
                    queue.append(curr.right)
            res.append(level)
        return res
```
**Review**
The traversal correctly separates node values by level using a queue and loop based on the current queue size.

The use of deque ensures efficient popping from the front.

Edge case of an empty tree is handled explicitly.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes (each node is visited once).

Space Complexity: O(n), for the queue and the final result list.
