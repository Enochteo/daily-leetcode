## Search in Rotated Sorted Array - Neetcode 150

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Given a rotated sorted array with no duplicates, return the index of a
target value. If not found, return -1. The solution must run in O(log
n) time.

---

#### Understand

We are given:

A sorted array that was rotated at some unknown pivot

A target value to search for
We must return the index of the target in O(log n) time or -1 if not found.

Example:
`nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, `target = 0` → output: `4`

---
#### Match

This is a Binary Search problem with a twist:

The array is rotated and partially sorted

We can't directly apply regular binary search until we find the rotation pivot

After that, we determine whether to search in the left or right subarray

---
#### Plan

Find the pivot (smallest element) using binary search:

If `nums[mid] > nums[r]`, pivot is in the right half -> `l = mid + 1`

Else, pivot is in the left half → `r = mid`

Once pivot is found, compare `target` to `nums[pivot]` and `nums[-1]` to
decide which half to search:

If in the right half, search from pivot to `r`

Else, search from `0` to `pivot - 1`

Perform binary search in the appropriate half to locate the target.

#### Implement

```python
class Solution(object):
    def search(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[r]:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid
        pivot = l

        if target >= nums[pivot] and target <= nums[-1]:
            l = pivot
            r = len(nums) - 1
        else:
            l = 0
            r = pivot - 1

        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1

        return -1
```

#### Evaluate

- Handles rotated and non-rotated arrays

-  Efficiently finds the pivot

- Binary search used correctly in both halves

- Edge cases: one element, no match, exact rotation point match

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)


Efficiency:
This solution maintains logarithmic time by first identifying the
pivot, then using standard binary search in the correct half.

Robustness:
Handles all edge cases and works regardless of how the array is rotated.

Learnings:
This problem reinforces the importance of adapting binary search logic
to rotated or partially sorted arrays.
The key insight is: find the pivot first, then binary search like normal.
