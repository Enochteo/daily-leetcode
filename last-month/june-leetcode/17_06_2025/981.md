## Time Based Key-Value Store
https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple
values for the same key at different timestamps, and retrieve the
value for a key at a given timestamp (or the most recent one before
it).

**Understand**
Implement a class with two methods:
set(key, value, timestamp): Store a value with a key at a specific time.

get(key, timestamp): Retrieve the most recent value for that key where
the stored timestamp is less than or equal to the given timestamp.

Input: key: str, value: str, timestamp: int

Output: A string representing the value at or before the given timestamp

Constraint: Must handle up to 2 * 10⁵ operations efficiently

Example:
```python
CopyEdit
set("foo", "bar", 1)
get("foo", 1) => "bar"
get("foo", 3) => "bar"
set("foo", "bar2", 4)
get("foo", 4) => "bar2"
get("foo", 5) => "bar2"
```

**Match**
This is a design problem that involves:

Hashmap to associate keys with timestamped values

Binary search to find the most recent value for a given timestamp

Efficient retrieval -> hints at O(log n) search time -> binary search on
timestamp list

**Plan**
Use a defaultdict(list) to map each key to a list of [value, timestamp] pairs.

On set(), append the new [value, timestamp] to the list (timestamps
are strictly increasing).

On get():

Perform binary search to find the rightmost timestamp ≤ the given timestamp.

If found, return the associated value; otherwise return "".

**Implement**
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class TimeMap(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.mapper = defaultdict(list)

    def set(self, key, value, timestamp):
        self.mapper[key].append([value, timestamp])

    def get(self, key, timestamp):
        res = ""
        values = self.mapper.get(key, [])
        l, r = 0, len(values) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if values[mid][1] <= timestamp:
                res = values[mid][0]
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1
        return res
```

**Evaluate**

Handles multiple timestamps per key

Efficient binary search ensures fast lookup even with many entries

Time Complexity:

set: O(1)

get: O(log n) per key

Space Complexity: O(n) for storing all key-value-time entries
