## Permutation in String Neetcode 150 Medium
**Understand**
We are given two strings and asked two check if there is a permutation (arrangement or rearrangement) of the first string in the second string.
e.g
Input: adc, vtuadcsfg
Output: Boolean on whether or not adc or any of its permutations acd, dac, dca, cad, cda occurs in the second string.

**Match**
The problem involves sliding window and hash tables.

**Plan**
Actually, we could sort the first string and check whether or not it exists in the sorted version of the second string, but this is very brute force as it works in O(N^2logn) time, which is entirely innefficient.
The better solution would be two hash the first string in a table, and use a sliding window the length of the first string and slide the window until we find a window whose hash table is equal to that of the first string.
Then we return the boolean.

**Implement**
- Create the hash table and hash the first string as the key.
- implement the sliding window, with the left pointer at 0 and the second at the length of the first string (-1).
- slide the window and hash each slide. If you find any hash whose value is in the hash table return True
- else return false.
