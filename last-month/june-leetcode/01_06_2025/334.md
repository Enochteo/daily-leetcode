# Leetcode 75
## Increasing Triplet Subsequence - Medium
You just create two initial pointers for the first and second (Set them to infinity - float("inf")).
You then check for each letter:
- check if its less than first -> update with first
- check if its greater than the first and less than the second -> update with second
- now if you then find any number in this iteration greater than the second return True
or at the end just return false
Time complexity - O(n)
Space complexity - O(1)
