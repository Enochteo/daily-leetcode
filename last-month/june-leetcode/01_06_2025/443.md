## Continuation of Leetcode 75
## String Compression - Medium *
You have a pointer to track where you are in the new array (the input you are modifying in place), you also set a variable to count repeated characters.
Count repeated characters with a while loop.
Set the index of the current pointer to the letter, move the pointer by one and then set that index to the count.
Return the last count - (pointer to the last character)

Timme complexity - O(n)
Space complexity - O(1)
