## continuation of leetcode 75
## Delete the middle node of a linked list - Medium
Just use the hare-tortoise principle to get the middle node. 
Take note of the previous node of the middle and then point it the the node after the middle.
Log: This question felt like an easy, would've passed on the first try but there was an edge case for lists with only one node. :)
