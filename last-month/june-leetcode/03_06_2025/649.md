## Dota2 Senate
Understand:
The problem was to simulate rounds of senators exercising their rights based on some rules and predicting the winner.
e.g "RRDDRR" - R wins, so output "Radiant".

Match:
The question involves removing and operaiting (i.e the excercise of each senator's right) in FIFO so we use a queue. 

Plan:
So the plan is to compare the first occurences of each senate group, depending on where they appear in the string we know whether to ban or continue then at the end we announce victory.

Implement:
- create two queues, one for the radiants and one for the dires 
- populate each queue with the indices of the senators
- pop both from queues and compare each index. Whichever is smaller you append it back to its queue. Do this until one of the queues are empty.
- Return the name of the queue which still exists
