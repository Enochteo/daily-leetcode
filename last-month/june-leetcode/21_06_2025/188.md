## Rotate Array
This project rotates an array nums to the right by k steps, in-place, using a space-optimized solution. The approach is based on the reversal algorithm, a well-known trick that allows rotation without extra memory.

**Understand**
You're given:

A list nums

An integer k representing the number of steps to rotate

You need to rotate nums to the right by k steps â€” in-place, without using extra space.

**Match**
This problem fits the category of:

Array manipulation

In-place rotation

Space-optimized algorithms

It is similar in spirit to:

Reversing parts of an array

Rotating matrix rows/columns

**Plan**
Use the reversal trick:

Reverse the entire array.

Reverse the first k elements.

Reverse the remaining n - k elements.

This works because reversing the parts of a reversed array restores the original order â€” but rotated.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: None
        """
        n = len(nums)
        k %= n  # handle cases where k > n

        def rotate(start, end):
            while start < end:
                nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]
                start += 1
                end -= 1

        rotate(0, n - 1)      # Reverse entire array
        rotate(0, k - 1)      # Reverse first k elements
        rotate(k, n - 1)      # Reverse remaining elements
```

**Review**
The solution handles any k, including k > len(nums)

Rotates in O(n) time using only constant space

Very clean and efficient logic

rotate(start, end) is a helper that reverses any slice of the array in-place

**Evaluate**
Metric	Value
Time Complexity	O(n)
Space Complexity	O(1)
In-place	 Yes
Handles k > n	 Yes
