## 4 Sum
This project solves the 4Sum problem using sorting, nested loops, and the two-pointer technique. The goal is to find all unique quadruplets in the array that sum to a given target.

**Understand**
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return all unique quadruplets [a, b, c, d] such that:

```python
a + b + c + d == target
```
The solution must avoid duplicate quadruplets.

The result can be returned in any order.

Match
This is a natural extension of:

2Sum (hash map or two-pointer)

3Sum (fix one number, use two pointers)

4Sum (fix two numbers, use two pointers)

It fits the pattern of:

Sorting

Two-pointer strategy

Duplicate avoidance

Plan
Sort the array to make it easier to skip duplicates and apply the two-pointer strategy.

Use two nested loops to fix the first two numbers (i, j).

Use two pointers (l, r) to scan the remaining part of the array for matching pairs.

If the sum matches the target, store the quadruplet.

Skip duplicates at each level to ensure uniqueness.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def fourSum(self, nums, target):
        res = []
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums) - 3):
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                continue
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums) - 2):
                if j > i + 1 and nums[j] == nums[j - 1]:
                    continue
                l = j + 1
                r = len(nums) - 1
                while l < r:
                    total = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[l] + nums[r]
                    if total == target:
                        res.append([nums[i], nums[j], nums[l], nums[r]])
                        l += 1
                        r -= 1
                        while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l - 1]:
                            l += 1
                        while l < r and nums[r] == nums[r + 1]:
                            r -= 1
                    elif total < target:
                        l += 1
                    else:
                        r -= 1
        return res
```

**Review**
The array is sorted to help skip duplicates and use two-pointer logic.

The loop bounds are carefully chosen to avoid out-of-bounds errors.

Duplicate checks are applied at every level (i, j, l, r) to ensure only unique quadruplets are added.
