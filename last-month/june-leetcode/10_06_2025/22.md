## Generate Parentheses - Neetcode 150 Medium
**Understand**
The problem states to gennerate all possible combinations of open and closing parentheses following these rules:
- both (open and close parenthesis) must be of length n
- an open parenthesis must be closed by a respective parenthesis 

**Match**
The problem involves knnowledge fromm stacks and backtracking/dfs.

**Plan**
The plan is to create every combination of n open annd closed parenthesis using backtracking(recursion).

**Implement**
- we would need an helper function (recursive caller)

- the base case would be when the number of open and closed parenthesis are equal and equal to n
- else depending on which is less, we add them and call the function recursively but increasing the number of each.
- return the result

**Evaluate**
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space complexity: O(N) call stack
