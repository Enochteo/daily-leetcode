## Daily Temperatures - Neetcode 150 Medium
**Understand**
The problem is to return an array containing the length of how many steps it takes to get a higher temperature for the current temparature in that index.

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

**Match**
The problem involves knowledge from arrays and stacks

**Plan**
So we could iterate from the end of the list in reverse and while iterating also append to a stack. The idea is that we continue to increment the counter until the last index in the stack is greater than what is to be pushed into the stack.

**Implement**
- create a list of zeros equal to the length of the temperatures
- initialize the stack
- iterate the list in reverse
- while the stack exists and the last value of the stack is less than what is to be pushed: pop the stack.
- then we update the results list with res[i] = stack[-1] - i
- and then we append to the stack

**Evaluate**
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space complexity: O(N)
