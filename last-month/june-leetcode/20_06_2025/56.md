## Merge Intervals
This project solves the classic Merge Intervals problem. Given a list of intervals where some may overlap, the goal is to merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of the merged intervals.

**Understand**
You're given a list of intervals [[start1, end1], [start2, end2], ...].

If any two intervals overlap (i.e. start2 <= end1), merge them into one.

Return a list of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

Sorting + Iteration

Greedy Merging of overlapping segments

Common in interval-based scheduling or timeline problems


**Plan**
Sort the intervals by their start times.

Initialize a current interval with the first interval.

Iterate through the remaining intervals:

If the current interval overlaps with the next one, merge them.

If not, add the current interval to the result list and move to the next.

Add the final current interval to the result.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def merge(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        intervals.sort()
        res = []
        current = intervals[0]
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0] <= current[1]:
                current = [min(current[0], intervals[i][0]), max(current[1], intervals[i][1])]
            else:
                res.append(current)
                current = intervals[i]
        res.append(current)
        return res
```
**Review**
The intervals are sorted to ensure that overlapping ones are adjacent.

Only one pass is needed after sorting — efficient and readable.

Edge cases like fully contained intervals or touching endpoints are handled.

Final merged interval is added at the end.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity:

Sorting: O(n log n)

Merging: O(n)
→ Overall: O(n log n)

Space Complexity:

O(n) for the result list
