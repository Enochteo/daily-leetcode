## Reverse Linked List
This function reverses a singly linked list using a recursive approach.

**Understand**
You are given the head of a singly linked list. Your task is to reverse the list and return the new head.

Example:
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
Output: 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1

**Match**
This problem falls under:

Singly linked list manipulation

Recursive pointer updates

Tail-to-head reversal strategy

**Plan**
Base Case: If the list is empty or has only one node, return the head as is.

Recursive Case:

Recursively call the function on head.next to reverse the rest of the list.

After recursion returns, make the next node point back to the current head.

Set head.next = None to terminate the reversed list properly.

Return the new head (last), which is the tail of the original list.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        
        last = self.reverseList(head.next)
        head.next.next = head
        head.next = None
        return last
```

**Review**
The recursion reaches the last node and builds the reversed list as it backtracks.

head.next.next = head makes the node point backward.

head.next = None prevents cycles.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

Space Complexity: O(n) due to the recursion stack.
