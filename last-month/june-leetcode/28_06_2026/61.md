## Rotate Linked List Right
This project rotates a singly linked list to the right by k places. The key idea is to locate the new head node after the rotation and rewire the list accordingly.

**Understand**
You are given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k. Rotate the list to the right by k places.

**Example**:

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, k = 2  
Output: 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

Linked list is non-empty

Must maintain node order after rotation

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

Linked list traversal

Length-based pointer manipulation

Reconnecting list segments

**Plan**
Edge Case: If the list is empty, return None.

Count length of the list to determine effective rotation:
→ k = k % length

If k == 0, no rotation needed, return the original head.

Traverse to the (length - k - 1)-th node. This node’s next will become the new head.

Break the list at this node.

Connect the tail of the new list to the original head.

Return the new head.

Implement
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotateRight(self, head, k):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        if not head:
            return head
        
        # Step 1: Find the length
        length = 0
        current = head
        while current:
            length += 1
            current = current.next
        
        k %= length
        if k == 0:
            return head

        # Step 2: Find the new head
        current = head
        for _ in range(length - k - 1):
            current = current.next
        new_head = current.next
        current.next = None

        # Step 3: Connect end to old head
        tail = new_head
        while tail.next:
            tail = tail.next
        tail.next = head
        
        return new_head
```

**Review**
Uses only O(1) extra space

Handles large k efficiently with modulo

Rewires the list safely and cleanly
