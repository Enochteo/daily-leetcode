## Delete Node in a BST
Understand:
The problem is to delete a node in a BST and replace that node with its appropriate value

Match:
This involves binary search operations + binary tree + recursion

Plan:
- We would have to search for the node we want to delete using binary search and then perform the deletion operation on that node
- Deletion means if the node has:
    - No children: replace with None
    - One child: replace with that child
    - Two children: you have to find the leftmost child of the right subtree and replace the node with that.

Implement: 
1. base case (if the root is none return none)
2. if the root is greater than the key, then the left node is changed to the result of passing the delete function with the left node
3. vice verse for less than
4. the else case means we have found the node to be deleted, now check if it has children
5. if it has only no child return None (coz you passed this into the previous node i.e either .left or .right, it becomes None-deleted)
6. if after the first pass it means it must have at least one child (left, right or both), so you can easily check if root.left is None, root.right can not be none so you just make root equals root.right and vice versa
7. if it has both children then you search for the minimum value of the right subtree (You traverse the right subtree with an helper function and return its leftmost node)
8. you replace the root.val with that value unlike with one children when you returned the node (root = root.left)
then you delete the right node like you did in 2

Review:
- Time complexity: O()
- Space complexity:
