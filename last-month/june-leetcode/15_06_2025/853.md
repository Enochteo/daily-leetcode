## Car Fleet - Neetcode 150 Medium
**Understand**
The problem is that, given two arrays, one for position and one for speed we are to find the number of fleets that would arrive at the target position. Fleets would be formed by cars that collide or intersect positions (the speed of the slower, the one at the front, becomes the speed of both)

**Match**
The problem involves Stacks and some sorting.

**Plan**
The plan would be to combine each position with their respective speeds first.
Then for each car we check how much time is left for each to reach the target. Then we sort and check in reverse order. If we find a car with a smaller position but collides with a car at the front they both get the speed of the car at the front and we keep only one speed for the whole fleet. Then we count the number of speeds as the number of fleets. 

**Implement**
- combine each position and speed into tuples and put each tuple in an array.
- sort and reverse the array.
- initialize a stack to store the time it takes for each car to get to the target.
- if you encounter a lesser position , but has a lesser time to complete, do not add to the stack
- add others (as you move in the opposite direction)
- return the length of the stack.

**Evaluate**
- Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Space complexity: O(n)
