## Crossword Puzzle
**Understand**

We are asked to fill a 10x10 crossword grid with a given set of words.

The crossword is represented by a list of strings, where:

'-' represents an empty cell where letters can be placed.

'+' represents a blocked cell.

We are given words in the form "WORD1;WORD2;WORD3;...".

Each word must be placed horizontally or vertically.

The filled crossword must be valid â€” all words must fit exactly, align properly, and not conflict with other words.

This is a constraint satisfaction problem, well-suited to backtracking recursion.

**Match**

This problem matches the backtracking / DFS search pattern:

Pick a word to place.

Try to place it in every valid horizontal or vertical position.

If a placement is valid, recursively attempt to place the next word.

If all words are placed, return the solution.

If not, undo the placement (backtrack) and try another option.
