## Crossword Puzzle
**Understand**

We are asked to fill a 10x10 crossword grid with a given set of words.

The crossword is represented by a list of strings, where:

'-' represents an empty cell where letters can be placed.

'+' represents a blocked cell.

We are given words in the form "WORD1;WORD2;WORD3;...".

Each word must be placed horizontally or vertically.

The filled crossword must be valid â€” all words must fit exactly, align properly, and not conflict with other words.

This is a constraint satisfaction problem, well-suited to backtracking recursion.

**Match**

This problem matches the backtracking / DFS search pattern:

Pick a word to place.

Try to place it in every valid horizontal or vertical position.

If a placement is valid, recursively attempt to place the next word.

If all words are placed, return the solution.

If not, undo the placement (backtrack) and try another option.

**Plan**

Preprocess input:

Split the words string by ;.

Convert the crossword grid into a mutable 2D list.

Helper functions:

can_place_h(r, c, word): Check if a word fits horizontally at (r, c).

can_place_v(r, c, word): Check if a word fits vertically at (r, c).

place_horizontal(r, c, word) / place_vertical(r, c, word): Place word, record changed positions.

unplace(placed): Undo a placement by restoring '-' in changed cells.

Backtracking recursion:

Base case: if all words are placed, return True.

Recursive step: try each word in each valid position.

If a placement leads to a solution, return True. Otherwise backtrack.

Return solution: Join the grid back into a list of strings.
