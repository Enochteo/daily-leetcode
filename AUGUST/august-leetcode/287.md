## Find the Duplicate Number

**Understand**
You are given an integer array nums of size n + 1 where each number is in the range [1, n].
There is only one repeated number, but it may be repeated more than once.

You must not modify the array and must use only constant extra space.

**Plan**
Treat the array as a linked list where:

Each index points to the next node via its value (nums[i])

A duplicate creates a cycle

Use two phases:

Phase 1 (Cycle detection):

Use slow and fast pointers to detect a cycle.

Slow moves one step, fast moves two steps.

Phase 2 (Cycle entrance):

Initialize one pointer at start, the other at the meeting point.

Move both at the same speed until they meet again.

That meeting point is the duplicate.
