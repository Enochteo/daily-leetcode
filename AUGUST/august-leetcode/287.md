## Find the Duplicate Number

**Understand**
You are given an integer array nums of size n + 1 where each number is in the range [1, n].
There is only one repeated number, but it may be repeated more than once.

You must not modify the array and must use only constant extra space.

**Plan**
Treat the array as a linked list where:

Each index points to the next node via its value (nums[i])

A duplicate creates a cycle

Use two phases:

Phase 1 (Cycle detection):

Use slow and fast pointers to detect a cycle.

Slow moves one step, fast moves two steps.

Phase 2 (Cycle entrance):

Initialize one pointer at start, the other at the meeting point.

Move both at the same speed until they meet again.

That meeting point is the duplicate.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Phase 1: detect cycle
        slow = fast = nums[0]  
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if fast == slow:
                break

        # Phase 2: find entrance to the cycle
        ptr1 = nums[0]
        ptr2 = slow
        while ptr1 != ptr2:
            ptr1 = nums[ptr1]
            ptr2 = nums[ptr2]
        return ptr1
```
**Review**
The array forms a cycle due to the pigeonhole principle.

This algorithm does not modify the array and uses O(1) extra space.

Works only because there is exactly one duplicate.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n)

Both phases run in linear time.

Space Complexity: O(1)

Uses only pointers, no extra data structures.

**Pattern to Remember By**
Use Floydâ€™s cycle detection when an array maps into itself and you're asked to find a repetition with O(1) space and no modification.
