## Simplify Path
**Understand**
Given an absolute Unix-style path string, simplify it:

. means current directory (ignore).

.. means go up one directory (pop stack if not empty).

Multiple slashes / are treated as a single slash.

Result must be a canonical path starting with /, without trailing /, except root.

**Match**
Stack-based parsing. Traverse the path, splitting into components by /:

If .. → pop stack if not empty.

If . or empty → skip.

Else → push directory name.
