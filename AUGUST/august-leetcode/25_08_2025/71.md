## Simplify Path
**Understand**
Given an absolute Unix-style path string, simplify it:

. means current directory (ignore).

.. means go up one directory (pop stack if not empty).

Multiple slashes / are treated as a single slash.

Result must be a canonical path starting with /, without trailing /, except root.
