## Integer to Roman
**Understand**
Convert an integer (1 ≤ num ≤ 3999) to a Roman numeral string.
Roman numerals have fixed symbol rules (M=1000, D=500, C=100, L=50, X=10, V=5, I=1, plus special subtractive forms like IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM).

**Match**
Greedy algorithm: repeatedly subtract the largest Roman value ≤ num, appending its symbol, until num == 0. Requires the mapping to be in descending order.

**Plan**

Prepare a mapping of values → symbols, including subtractive forms (900, 400, 90, 40, 9, 4).

Iterate over the mapping in descending order:

Compute how many times current value fits into num.

Append that many symbols to result.

Subtract accordingly.

Stop early if num becomes 0.
