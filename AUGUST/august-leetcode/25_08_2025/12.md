## Integer to Roman
**Understand**
Convert an integer (1 ≤ num ≤ 3999) to a Roman numeral string.
Roman numerals have fixed symbol rules (M=1000, D=500, C=100, L=50, X=10, V=5, I=1, plus special subtractive forms like IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM).

**Match**
Greedy algorithm: repeatedly subtract the largest Roman value ≤ num, appending its symbol, until num == 0. Requires the mapping to be in descending order.

**Plan**

Prepare a mapping of values → symbols, including subtractive forms (900, 400, 90, 40, 9, 4).

Iterate over the mapping in descending order:

Compute how many times current value fits into num.

Append that many symbols to result.

Subtract accordingly.

Stop early if num becomes 0.

**Implement**
```py
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        roman = {
            1000: "M", 900: "CM", 500: "D", 400: "CD",
            100: "C", 90: "XC", 50: "L", 40: "XL",
            10: "X", 9: "IX", 5: "V", 4: "IV", 1: "I"
        }
        res = ''
        for val, rom in roman.items():
            if num == 0:
                break
            count = num // val
            res += rom * count
            num -= count * val
        return res
```
**Review**

Works correctly if iteration respects descending order. In Python 3.7+, dict preserves insertion order, so the mapping must be written top-to-bottom descending as shown.

Handles subtractive cases explicitly (e.g., 4 → IV, 9 → IX).

Stops early if number is reduced to 0.
