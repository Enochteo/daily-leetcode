## Island Perimeter
**Understand**
Given a 0/1 grid with exactly one island (4-directionally connected) and no lakes, compute the island’s perimeter.

Each land cell contributes 4 edges.

Each shared edge between two adjacent land cells subtracts 2 from the perimeter (because it’s counted for both cells).

**Match**
Grid scan with adjacency counting. For each land cell, increment land count and count shared edges to the down and right neighbors to avoid double-counting.

**Plan**

Iterate all cells; when a cell is land, increment squares.

For that land cell, if the cell below is land, increment connections. If the cell to the right is land, increment connections.

Final perimeter = 4 * squares - 2 * connections.


**Implement**
```py
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        squares = 0
        connections = 0

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    squares += 1
                    if r+1 <= rows - 1 and grid[r + 1][c] == 1:
                        connections += 1
                    if c+1 <= cols -1 and grid[r][c+1] == 1:
                        connections += 1
                    
        return (squares * 4) - 2*(connections)
```

**Review**

Only checking down and right ensures each shared edge is counted exactly once.

Works for any single 4-connected island without lakes; edges touching water or grid boundary naturally contribute to the perimeter via the formula.
