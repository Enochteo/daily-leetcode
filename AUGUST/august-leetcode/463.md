## Island Perimeter
**Understand**
Given a 0/1 grid with exactly one island (4-directionally connected) and no lakes, compute the island’s perimeter.

Each land cell contributes 4 edges.

Each shared edge between two adjacent land cells subtracts 2 from the perimeter (because it’s counted for both cells).
