## Island Perimeter
**Understand**
Given a 0/1 grid with exactly one island (4-directionally connected) and no lakes, compute the island’s perimeter.

Each land cell contributes 4 edges.

Each shared edge between two adjacent land cells subtracts 2 from the perimeter (because it’s counted for both cells).

**Match**
Grid scan with adjacency counting. For each land cell, increment land count and count shared edges to the down and right neighbors to avoid double-counting.

**Plan**

Iterate all cells; when a cell is land, increment squares.

For that land cell, if the cell below is land, increment connections. If the cell to the right is land, increment connections.

Final perimeter = 4 * squares - 2 * connections.
