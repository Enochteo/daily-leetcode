## Valid Parenthesis String
**Understand**
Given a string s containing '(', ')', and '*':

'*' can represent '(', ')', or an empty string.
Return whether s can be a valid parenthesis string.

Constraints: balanced parentheses with flexible use of *.

**Match**
Greedy + stack indices:

Track indices of `'('` and `'*'`.

When encountering ')', try to match with `'('` first, else with '*'.

After scan, some `'('` may remain unmatched. Use available '*' after them (treat as `')'`).

If any `'('` has no later `'*'`, invalid.

**Plan**

Initialize two stacks:

open_stack: indices of `'('`.

stars: indices of `'*'`.

Iterate string:

`'('` → push index to open_stack.

`'*'` → push index to stars.

`')'` → pop from open_stack if available, else from stars, else invalid → return False.

After iteration:

While both open_stack and stars non-empty, check ordering. If the `'*'` index is after the `'('` index, pop both (valid). If not, invalid.

Return True if open_stack is empty, else False.
