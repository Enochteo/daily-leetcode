## Valid Parenthesis String
**Understand**
Given a string s containing '(', ')', and '*':

'*' can represent '(', ')', or an empty string.
Return whether s can be a valid parenthesis string.

Constraints: balanced parentheses with flexible use of *.

**Match**
Greedy + stack indices:

Track indices of `'('` and `'*'`.

When encountering ')', try to match with `'('` first, else with '*'.

After scan, some `'('` may remain unmatched. Use available '*' after them (treat as `')'`).

If any `'('` has no later `'*'`, invalid.
