## Queue Reconstruction by Height
**Understand**
We’re given a list people, where each person is represented as [h, k]:

h = height

k = number of people in front of this person with height ≥ h

We need to reconstruct the queue that satisfies all k constraints.

**Match**
Greedy approach:

Sort people by height descending, then by k ascending.

Place each person into the result at index k.
Why it works:

Taller people are unaffected by shorter ones, so we position them first.

When inserting by k, the taller ones already placed guarantee the correct counts.

**Plan**

Sort people with key: (-h, k).

Initialize empty result ans.

For each person [h, k], insert them into ans at index k.

Return ans.
