## Queue Reconstruction by Height
**Understand**
We’re given a list people, where each person is represented as [h, k]:

h = height

k = number of people in front of this person with height ≥ h

We need to reconstruct the queue that satisfies all k constraints.

**Match**
Greedy approach:

Sort people by height descending, then by k ascending.

Place each person into the result at index k.
Why it works:

Taller people are unaffected by shorter ones, so we position them first.

When inserting by k, the taller ones already placed guarantee the correct counts.

**Plan**

Sort people with key: (-h, k).

Initialize empty result ans.

For each person [h, k], insert them into ans at index k.

Return ans.

**Implement**
```py
class Solution(object):
    def reconstructQueue(self, people):
        """
        :type people: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        people.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
        ans = []
        for p in people:
            ans.insert(p[1], p)
        return ans
```

**Review**

Sorting ensures taller people are placed first, preventing interference by shorter ones.

List insert maintains the order as required.

Correct because inserting at k automatically ensures exactly k taller-or-equal people before.

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: O(n²) in worst case due to list insert operations.

Space Complexity: O(n).

Optimizations: using linked list could reduce insert cost, but Python list insert is acceptable.

**Pattern to remember**
For problems involving ordering by constraints: sort by primary attribute (height descending), then insert by secondary attribute (k ascending) so that earlier placements lock in the invariant
