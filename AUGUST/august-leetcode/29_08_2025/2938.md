## Separate Black and White Balls
**Understand**
We are given a binary string s consisting of '0' (white balls) and '1' (black balls). Each operation lets you swap two adjacent balls. We want the minimum number of swaps required to group all white balls to the right and all black balls to the left.

Observation: Every '0' must cross over all '1's that appear before it. Each such pair contributes exactly one swap.

**Match**
Greedy counting:

Track how many '1's weâ€™ve seen so far.

For each '0', add that count to swaps.

**Plan**

Initialize ones = 0, swaps = 0.

Traverse string s:

If char == '1': increment ones.

Else (char == '0'): add ones to swaps.

Return swaps.

**Implement**
```py
class Solution(object):
    def minimumSteps(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        ones = 0
        swaps = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == '1':
                ones += 1
            else:
                swaps += ones
        return swaps
```
