## Minimum Swaps to Group All 1’s Together II

**Understand**
We want to group all the 1s in a binary circular array with minimum swaps. Equivalent: find the maximum number of 1s that can already fit into a contiguous window of length ones = total number of 1s. Then the number of swaps needed = ones - max_ones_in_window.

Because the array is circular, extend nums by concatenating it with itself and scan windows of size ones across length n.

**Match**
Sliding window over doubled array. Keep track of how many 1’s in the current window, update max, then compute result.
