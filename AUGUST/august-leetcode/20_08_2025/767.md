## Reorganize String
**Understand**
Given a string s, rearrange its letters so that no two adjacent characters are the same. If it’s impossible, return "".

Key constraint: if any character’s count exceeds (len(s)+1)//2, rearrangement is impossible.

**Match**
Greedy with a max-heap (by frequency). Always place the currently most frequent available character, while keeping the previously used character “on hold” until the next step so it doesn’t repeat.
