## Maximum 69 Number
**Understand**
You’re given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9. You may change at most one digit 6 to 9. Return the maximum possible value after at most one change. If there’s no 6, return num unchanged.

**Match**
Greedy + digit scan. The optimal move is to flip the most significant 6 to 9, since increasing a higher place yields the largest gain.

**Plan**
Scan digits to find the index of the most significant 6, then add 3 * 10^index to num (since 9 - 6 = 3).

Work left-to-right (string) to find first 6, or

Work right-to-left (integer arithmetic), remembering the highest index where a 6 occurs.
