## Maximum 69 Number
**Understand**
You’re given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9. You may change at most one digit 6 to 9. Return the maximum possible value after at most one change. If there’s no 6, return num unchanged.

**Match**
Greedy + digit scan. The optimal move is to flip the most significant 6 to 9, since increasing a higher place yields the largest gain.
