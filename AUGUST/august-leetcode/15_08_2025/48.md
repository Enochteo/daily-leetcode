## Rotate Image
**Understand**
Given an n x n matrix, rotate it 90Â° clockwise in-place (no extra n x n storage). We must permute elements so each ring (outer to inner) rotates.

**Match**
In-place matrix manipulation using layer-by-layer 4-way cyclic swaps (top, right, bottom, left). Alternative approach is transpose + reverse rows.
