## Rotate Image
**Understand**
Given an n x n matrix, rotate it 90Â° clockwise in-place (no extra n x n storage). We must permute elements so each ring (outer to inner) rotates.

**Match**
In-place matrix manipulation using layer-by-layer 4-way cyclic swaps (top, right, bottom, left). Alternative approach is transpose + reverse rows.

**Plan**

Maintain two bounds: l (left/top) and r (right/bottom).

For each layer while l < r, rotate the ring by iterating offsets i in [0 .. r-l-1] and performing a 4-way swap among:

(top, l+i), (top+i, r), (bottom, r-i), (bottom-i, l)

Move inward (l += 1, r -= 1) and repeat.
