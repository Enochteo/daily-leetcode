## Spiral Matrix
**Understand**
Given an m x n matrix, return all elements in spiral order starting at the top-left: go right across the top row, down the right column, left across the bottom row, and up the left column, then repeat for inner layers until all elements are visited. Handle rectangular matrices and edge cases like single row/column and empty input.
