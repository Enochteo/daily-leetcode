## Task Scheduler
**Understand**
You are given a list of tasks (uppercase letters) and a non-negative cooldown n. Each identical task must be separated by at least n time units. In one time unit you can either execute one task (if available) or be idle. Return the minimum total time units to finish all tasks.
