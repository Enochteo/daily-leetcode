## Task Scheduler
**Understand**
You are given a list of tasks (uppercase letters) and a non-negative cooldown n. Each identical task must be separated by at least n time units. In one time unit you can either execute one task (if available) or be idle. Return the minimum total time units to finish all tasks.

**Match**
Greedy simulation with a max-heap to always pick the most frequent available task, plus a queue to track tasks in cooldown and when they become available again.
Alternative closed-form approach uses count of most frequent tasks, but the heap simulation is straightforward and general.
