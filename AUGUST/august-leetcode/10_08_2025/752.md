## Open the Lock
**Understand**
You have a lock with 4 wheels, each showing a digit 0â€“9. From any state, a move consists of turning one wheel up or down by one (wrapping around).
Given a list of deadend states you cannot enter and a target state, return the minimum number of moves to reach the target from "0000". If impossible, return -1.
