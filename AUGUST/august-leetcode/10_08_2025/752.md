## Open the Lock
**Understand**
You have a lock with 4 wheels, each showing a digit 0–9. From any state, a move consists of turning one wheel up or down by one (wrapping around).
Given a list of deadend states you cannot enter and a target state, return the minimum number of moves to reach the target from "0000". If impossible, return -1.

**Match**
Shortest path in an unweighted graph of states → Breadth-First Search (BFS)

State space: all 4-digit strings 0000–9999

Generate neighbors by rotating each wheel up/down

**Plan**
If "0000" is a deadend, return -1.

Use BFS from "0000", tracking (state, distance) in a queue.

For each state, generate up to 8 neighbors by incrementing/decrementing each wheel.

Skip states already visited or in deadends.

When the target is dequeued, return its distance (turn count).

If BFS exhausts without reaching target, return -1.
