## Graph Valid Tree
**Understand**
You're given:

An integer n (number of nodes labeled 0 to n-1)

A list of edges

Goal:
Return True if the given edges form a valid tree (acyclic and connected), else False.

**Match**
This is a graph validation problem.

Tree Properties:

Must be connected (all nodes reachable)

Must be acyclic (no cycles)

Must have exactly n - 1 edges (key property of a tree)

**Plan**
Early check: If number of edges â‰  n - 1, it's not a tree.

Build an adjacency list.

Use DFS:

Traverse nodes and track visited nodes

Avoid going back to the parent

If you revisit any node that's already visited (excluding the parent), it's a cycle

After DFS:

Check if all n nodes were visited (i.e., graph is connected)
