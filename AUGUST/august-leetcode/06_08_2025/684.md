## Redundant Connection
**Understand**
You're given a list of edges representing a tree with one extra edge (i.e., a cycle).

Goal:
Return the one edge that, when removed, will leave the graph as a valid tree (acyclic and connected). If multiple answers are valid, return the one that appears last in the input.

**Match**
This is a cycle detection problem in an undirected graph.

Techniques:

DFS with visited set

Union-Find (more optimal)

Adjacency list and backtracking

**Plan**
Maintain a graph as an adjacency list (defaultdict(set)).

For every edge (u, v):

Use DFS to check if u can already reach v.

If yes, adding this edge would form a cycle â†’ return [u, v].

If no, safely add the edge to the graph.

**Implement**
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution(object):
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges):
        graph_map = defaultdict(set)

        def dfs(source, target, visited):
            if source == target:
                return True
            visited.add(source)
            for neighbor in graph_map[source]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    if dfs(neighbor, target, visited):
                        return True
            return False

        for u, v in edges:
            visited = set()
            if u in graph_map and v in graph_map and dfs(u, v, visited):
                return [u, v]
            graph_map[u].add(v)
            graph_map[v].add(u)
