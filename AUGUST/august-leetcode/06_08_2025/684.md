## Redundant Connection
**Understand**
You're given a list of edges representing a tree with one extra edge (i.e., a cycle).

Goal:
Return the one edge that, when removed, will leave the graph as a valid tree (acyclic and connected). If multiple answers are valid, return the one that appears last in the input.

**Match**
This is a cycle detection problem in an undirected graph.

Techniques:

DFS with visited set

Union-Find (more optimal)

Adjacency list and backtracking

**Plan**
Maintain a graph as an adjacency list (defaultdict(set)).

For every edge (u, v):

Use DFS to check if u can already reach v.

If yes, adding this edge would form a cycle â†’ return [u, v].

If no, safely add the edge to the graph.
