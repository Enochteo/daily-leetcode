## Assign Cookies
**Understand**
We have:

g[i] = greed factor of child i.

s[j] = size of cookie j.

Each child gets at most one cookie, and a child is content if cookie â‰¥ greed. The goal is to maximize the number of content children.

**Match**
Greedy two-pointer approach:

Sort both arrays.

Assign the smallest cookie that satisfies the current least-greedy child.

If the cookie is too small, skip it.
