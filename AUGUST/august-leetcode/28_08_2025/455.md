## Assign Cookies
**Understand**
We have:

g[i] = greed factor of child i.

s[j] = size of cookie j.

Each child gets at most one cookie, and a child is content if cookie ≥ greed. The goal is to maximize the number of content children.

**Match**
Greedy two-pointer approach:

Sort both arrays.

Assign the smallest cookie that satisfies the current least-greedy child.

If the cookie is too small, skip it.

**Plan**

Sort g and s.

Initialize i = 0 (child), j = 0 (cookie), content = 0.

While both indices in range:

If s[j] >= g[i]: assign cookie to child → increment both i and j, increment content.

Else: skip cookie j (j += 1).

Return content.

**Implement**
```py
class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        content = 0
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= len(g) - 1 and j <= len(s) - 1:
            if g[i] <= s[j]:
                i += 1
                j += 1
                content += 1
            else:
                j += 1
        return content
```

**Review**

Sorting ensures we always try to satisfy the least greedy child first with the smallest sufficient cookie.

Skips insufficient cookies without wasting children.

Maximizes the number of children satisfied.

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: O(n log n + m log m), due to sorting.

Space Complexity: O(1).
