## Partition Labels
**Understand**
We are given a string s. Partition it into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. Return a list of partition sizes.

Example:
s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij" â†’ [9,7,8].

Key: Each partition boundary occurs when all characters in the current window have their last occurrence inside that window.
