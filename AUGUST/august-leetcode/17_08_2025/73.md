## Set Matrix Zeroes
**Understand**
Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place (mutate matrix).

**Match**
Two-pass approach using extra storage: first collect coordinates of all zeros, then for each recorded zero, zero out its whole row and column.

**Plan**

Scan the matrix and push every zero coordinate (r, c) into a stack/list.

While the stack isn’t empty, pop a zero position and set all cells in its row or column to 0.

Because the original zero positions were recorded first, later writes won’t create new “source” zeros.

**Implement**
```py
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        zeros = []
        rows = len(matrix)
        cols = len(matrix[0])

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if matrix[r][c] == 0:
                    zeros.append((r,c))
        while zeros:
            zero_r, zero_c = zeros.pop()
            for r in range(rows):
                for c in range(cols):
                    if r == zero_r or c == zero_c:
                        matrix[r][c] = 0
```

**Review**

Recording zero positions first prevents cascading creation of new “source” zeros during the zeroing phase.

Works for multiple zeros and overlapping rows/columns.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity:

First pass O(mn) to collect zeros.

For each of k recorded zeros, a full O(mn) pass in the nested loops, so worst case O(k·mn) (often O(mn + k(m+n)) if you restructure the second pass to write row-by-row/col-by-col).
Space Complexity: O(k) to store zero coordinates.
