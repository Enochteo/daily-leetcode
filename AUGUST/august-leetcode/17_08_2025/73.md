## Set Matrix Zeroes
**Understand**
Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place (mutate matrix).

**Match**
Two-pass approach using extra storage: first collect coordinates of all zeros, then for each recorded zero, zero out its whole row and column.

**Plan**

Scan the matrix and push every zero coordinate (r, c) into a stack/list.

While the stack isn’t empty, pop a zero position and set all cells in its row or column to 0.

Because the original zero positions were recorded first, later writes won’t create new “source” zeros.
