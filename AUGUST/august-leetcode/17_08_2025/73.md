## Set Matrix Zeroes
**Understand**
Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place (mutate matrix).

**Match**
Two-pass approach using extra storage: first collect coordinates of all zeros, then for each recorded zero, zero out its whole row and column.
