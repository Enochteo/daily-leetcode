## Set Matrix Zeroes (O(1) Extra Space)

**Understand**
Given an m x n matrix, if any element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0, modifying the matrix in-place. Target constant auxiliary space.

**Match**
In-place flagging: reuse the first row and first column as marker arrays and carry two booleans to remember whether the first row or first column themselves should be zeroed.

**Plan**

Determine whether the first row and the first column contain any zeros (store in two booleans).

For every inner cell (r,c) with r≥1, c≥1: if it’s 0, mark its row and column by setting matrix[r][0] = 0 and matrix[0][c] = 0.

Second pass over inner cells: if the row’s marker or the column’s marker is 0, set that cell to 0.

Finally zero the first column if needed, and zero the first row if needed.
