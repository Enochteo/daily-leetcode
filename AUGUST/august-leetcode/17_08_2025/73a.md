## Set Matrix Zeroes (O(1) Extra Space)

**Understand**
Given an m x n matrix, if any element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0, modifying the matrix in-place. Target constant auxiliary space.

**Match**
In-place flagging: reuse the first row and first column as marker arrays and carry two booleans to remember whether the first row or first column themselves should be zeroed.
