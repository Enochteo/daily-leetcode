## Set Matrix Zeroes (O(1) Extra Space)

**Understand**
Given an m x n matrix, if any element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0, modifying the matrix in-place. Target constant auxiliary space.

**Match**
In-place flagging: reuse the first row and first column as marker arrays and carry two booleans to remember whether the first row or first column themselves should be zeroed.

**Plan**

Determine whether the first row and the first column contain any zeros (store in two booleans).

For every inner cell (r,c) with r≥1, c≥1: if it’s 0, mark its row and column by setting matrix[r][0] = 0 and matrix[0][c] = 0.

Second pass over inner cells: if the row’s marker or the column’s marker is 0, set that cell to 0.

Finally zero the first column if needed, and zero the first row if needed.

**Implement**
```py
class Solution:
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        rows = len(matrix)
        cols = len(matrix[0])
        firstRow = False
        firstCol = False
        # Check for any zeros in first row
            # set the flag to true
        for r in range(rows):
            if matrix[r][0] == 0:
                firstRow = True
        # Check for any zeros in first col    
            # set the flag to true
        for c in range(cols):
            if matrix[0][c] == 0:
                firstCol = True
        # Check for any zeros in the inner matrix
            # set the first cell in both row and col to zero
        for r in range(1, rows):
            for c in range(1, cols):
                if matrix[r][c] == 0:
                    matrix[r][0] = 0
                    matrix[0][c] = 0
        # Go through inner matrix and set the cell to zero if the first cell in its row or col is zero
        for r in range(1, rows):
            for c in range(1, cols):
                if matrix[0][c] == 0 or matrix[r][0] == 0:
                    matrix[r][c] = 0
        # check if there are any zero first cell in row or column and zero the row or column
        if firstRow:
            for r in range(rows):
                matrix[r][0] = 0
        if firstCol:
            for c in range(cols):
                matrix[0][c] = 0
```

**Review**

The algorithm follows the constant-space strategy: mark in first row/col, fill inner cells, then handle the first row/col last.

Note on flag naming in this snippet: firstRow is set by scanning the first column (matrix[r][0]), and firstCol is set by scanning the first row (matrix[0][c]). The final zeroing loops mirror that naming choice. This works as written, but the names are inverted relative to what they check, so be mindful when reasoning about it.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(mn).
Space Complexity: O(1) auxiliary (reuses matrix borders + two booleans).

**Pattern to remember**
To zero rows/columns based on zeros in-place: use the first row and first column as marker arrays, keep two booleans for whether those borders must be zeroed, mark first, apply to inner cells, then zero the first row/column last.
