## Merge Intervals
**Understand**
Given an array of intervals [[s1,e1], [s2,e2], ...], merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of non-overlapping intervals that covers the same ranges.

Overlap occurs when the next start s is <= the current merged end.

Intervals may be in any order.

**Match**
Sorting + linear sweep. After sorting by start, maintain a current merged interval and extend it while overlaps continue.
