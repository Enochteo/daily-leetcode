## Course Schedule II
**Understand**
You are given numCourses and a list of prerequisites (pairs [a, b] meaning to take course a, you must first take course b).

Goal:
Return a valid order to complete all courses, or an empty list if impossible.

**Match**
This is a Topological Sort problem:

Directed graph

Cycle detection needed (if there's a cycle, return [])

DFS-based post-order traversal can generate the topological order

**Plan**
Build adjacency list:
course_map[course] = [prerequisite1, prerequisite2, ...]

Use dfs(course) to:

Detect cycles using a path set

Track completed nodes in visited

Append nodes to result list (res) after all prerequisites are resolved (post-order)

If a cycle is detected, return [].
Otherwise, return the reverse of the result list.
