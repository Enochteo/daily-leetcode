## Minimum Absolute Difference in BST
**Understand**
You're given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST).
Find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes in the tree.

Constraints:

All values are unique.

Must take advantage of BST properties if possible.

Must return the minimum absolute difference between any pair of nodes.

**Match**
Applies to:

Binary Search Trees

Difference minimization

In-order traversal or DFS-based comparisons

Your approach:

For each node:

Compare the node's value to the max value in the left subtree

Compare it to the min value in the right subtree

Take the minimum of those and recurse
