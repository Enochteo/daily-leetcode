## Word Search
**Understand**
Given an m x n board of characters and a word, determine if the word exists in the grid by sequentially adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). You may not reuse a cell within the same path.

**Match**
Depth-first search with backtracking. Track a visited set to prevent revisiting cells on the current path.

**Plan**

For each cell as a starting point, attempt to match word via DFS.

At DFS (i, j, k), success if k == len(word).

Fail fast if out of bounds, already visited, or char mismatch.

Mark (i, j) visited, recurse into four neighbors with k+1, then unmark (backtrack).

If any start succeeds, return True; otherwise False.
