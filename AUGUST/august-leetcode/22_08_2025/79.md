## Word Search
**Understand**
Given an m x n board of characters and a word, determine if the word exists in the grid by sequentially adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). You may not reuse a cell within the same path.

**Match**
Depth-first search with backtracking. Track a visited set to prevent revisiting cells on the current path.
