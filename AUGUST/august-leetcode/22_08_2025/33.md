## Search in Rotated Sorted Array
**Understand**
We are given a sorted array rotated at some pivot (no duplicates). Task: return the index of target or -1 if not found.

Key idea: The array is “two sorted halves.” Find the pivot (smallest element) with binary search. Then perform a standard binary search in the half where the target could reside.

**Match**

Binary search to locate rotation pivot (minimum element).

Binary search again in the appropriate half.

**Plan**

Use binary search (l=0, r=n-1) to find the pivot (index of minimum):

If nums[mid] > nums[r], pivot is to the right → l = mid+1.

Else, pivot is at mid or left → r = mid.

After loop, pivot = l.

Decide which half to search:

If target in [nums[pivot], nums[n-1]], search in [pivot..n-1].

Else, search in [0..pivot-1].

Standard binary search on chosen half.

Return index if found, else -1.
