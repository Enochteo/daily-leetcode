## Search in Rotated Sorted Array
**Understand**
We are given a sorted array rotated at some pivot (no duplicates). Task: return the index of target or -1 if not found.

Key idea: The array is “two sorted halves.” Find the pivot (smallest element) with binary search. Then perform a standard binary search in the half where the target could reside.

**Match**

Binary search to locate rotation pivot (minimum element).

Binary search again in the appropriate half.
