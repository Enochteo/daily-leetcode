## Set Matrix Zeroes

**Understand**
Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0, modifying the matrix in-place. Optimize for constant auxiliary space.

**Match**
In-place flagging technique: reuse the first row and first column as marker arrays. Keep two booleans to remember whether the first row or first column themselves must be zeroed, then apply markers to inner cells before finally zeroing the borders.

**Plan**

Scan the first row to set set_first_row_to_zero.

Scan the first column to set set_first_col_to_zero.

For all inner cells (r,c) with r≥1, c≥1, if matrix[r][c] == 0, mark matrix[0][c] = 0 and matrix[r][0] = 0.

Second pass over inner cells: if the row marker or column marker is 0, set matrix[r][c] = 0.

If set_first_row_to_zero, zero the entire first row.

If set_first_col_to_zero, zero the entire first column.

**Implement**
```py
class Solution(object):
    def setZeroes(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        rows = len(matrix)
        cols = len(matrix[0])

        set_first_row_to_zero = False
        set_first_col_to_zero = False
        for c in range(cols):
            if matrix[0][c] == 0:
                set_first_row_to_zero = True
        for r in range(rows):
            if matrix[r][0] == 0:
                set_first_col_to_zero = True
        # go through the matrix except 1st row and column 
            # if any zero set the top row and col to zero
        for r in range(1, rows):
            for c in range(1, cols):
                if matrix[r][c] == 0:
                    matrix[0][c] = 0
                    matrix[r][0] = 0
        # go through first row and first column
            # if any zeros set the whole row/column to zero  
        for r in range(1, rows):
            for c in range(1, cols):
                if matrix[0][c] == 0 or matrix[r][0] == 0:
                    matrix[r][c] = 0

        if set_first_row_to_zero:
            for c in range(cols):
                matrix[0][c] = 0
        if set_first_col_to_zero:
            for r in range(rows):
                matrix[r][0] = 0
```
**Review**

First row/column store markers derived from original zeros (we mark first, apply second).

Final border zeroing is deferred to the end using the two booleans so marker information isn’t destroyed prematurely.

Handles all cases, including when the first row/col contain zeros initially.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(mn) with two full scans of the inner matrix plus border passes.
Space Complexity: O(1) auxiliary (reuses matrix borders and two booleans).

**Pattern to remember**
For in-place row/column zeroing: use first row/column as marker arrays, track whether they must be zeroed with two booleans, mark inner cells first, apply to inner cells next, then zero the first row/column last.
