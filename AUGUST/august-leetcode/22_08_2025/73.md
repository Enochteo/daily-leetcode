## Set Matrix Zeroes

**Understand**
Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0, modifying the matrix in-place. Optimize for constant auxiliary space.

**Match**
In-place flagging technique: reuse the first row and first column as marker arrays. Keep two booleans to remember whether the first row or first column themselves must be zeroed, then apply markers to inner cells before finally zeroing the borders.
