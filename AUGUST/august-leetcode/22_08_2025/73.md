## Set Matrix Zeroes

**Understand**
Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0, modifying the matrix in-place. Optimize for constant auxiliary space.

**Match**
In-place flagging technique: reuse the first row and first column as marker arrays. Keep two booleans to remember whether the first row or first column themselves must be zeroed, then apply markers to inner cells before finally zeroing the borders.

**Plan**

Scan the first row to set set_first_row_to_zero.

Scan the first column to set set_first_col_to_zero.

For all inner cells (r,c) with r≥1, c≥1, if matrix[r][c] == 0, mark matrix[0][c] = 0 and matrix[r][0] = 0.

Second pass over inner cells: if the row marker or column marker is 0, set matrix[r][c] = 0.

If set_first_row_to_zero, zero the entire first row.

If set_first_col_to_zero, zero the entire first column.
