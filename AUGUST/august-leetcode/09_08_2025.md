## Minimum Height Trees
**Understand**
Given an undirected graph with n nodes labeled 0..n-1 and edges forming a tree, return all the root labels of Minimum Height Trees (MHTs).
Observation: The root(s) of MHTs are the middle node(s) of the tree’s diameter path.

**Match**
Graph on a tree (connected, acyclic)

Longest path (tree diameter)

BFS on an unweighted graph

Centers of a path (one or two)

**Plan**
Build adjacency list for the tree.

Run BFS from any node (e.g., 0) to find the farthest node A.

Run BFS from A to find the farthest node B and track parents to reconstruct the diameter path A→…→B.

The MHT roots are the middle node(s) of that path:

If path length is odd → one center

If path length is even → two centers
