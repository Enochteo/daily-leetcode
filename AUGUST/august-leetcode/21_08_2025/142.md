## Linked List Cycle II

**Understand**
We are given the head of a singly linked list. If the list has a cycle, return the node where the cycle begins; otherwise, return None.

Key fact: If a cycle exists, the point where slow and fast pointers meet is guaranteed to be inside the cycle. The start of the cycle can be found by resetting one pointer to the head and moving both one step at a time until they meet.

**Match**
This is the classic Floyd’s Tortoise–Hare cycle detection problem:

Phase 1 – Detect if a cycle exists.

Phase 2 – Find the cycle’s entry point.
