## Find All Duplicates in an Array
**Understand**
We are given an integer array nums of length n, where each element is in the range [1, n]. Some numbers appear once, others appear twice. Return all numbers that appear twice, in any order.

Constraints: O(n) time, O(1) extra space (ignoring output).
