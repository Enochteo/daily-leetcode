## Find the Duplicate Number
**Understand**
We are given an array nums of length n+1 containing integers in [1..n]. Exactly one integer is repeated at least once. We must return the duplicate without modifying the array, in O(1) extra space and with better than O(n²) runtime.

By treating the array as a linked list (i → nums[i]), the duplicate value causes a cycle. The task reduces to finding the entry point of the cycle.

Floyd’s Tortoise–Hare algorithm for cycle detection.

Phase 1: detect intersection inside the cycle.

Phase 2: find the cycle’s entry point (duplicate number).
