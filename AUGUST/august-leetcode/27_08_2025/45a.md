## Jump Game II - Solution version 2
**Understand**
Given an array nums, where each nums[i] is the maximum jump length from index i, return the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index. It is guaranteed that you can always reach the end.

**Match**
Greedy scan.

Maintain farthest = max index reachable so far.

Maintain current_end = farthest index reachable with the current number of jumps.

When reaching current_end, increment jump count and update current_end = farthest.
This ensures each time we extend our range with minimal jumps (like BFS levels but optimized to O(n)).
