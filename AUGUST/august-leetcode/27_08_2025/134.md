## Gas Station
**Understand**
We are given two arrays gas and cost, each of length n.

gas[i] = amount of gas at station i.

cost[i] = gas needed to travel from station i to (i+1) % n.

Find the starting station index from which you can travel around the circuit once, or return -1 if impossible.

Observation:

If sum(gas) < sum(cost), total gas is insufficient â†’ return -1.

If a solution exists, it is unique.
