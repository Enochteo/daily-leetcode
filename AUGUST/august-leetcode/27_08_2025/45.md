## Jump Game II
**Understand**
You are given an array nums, where nums[i] is the maximum jump length from index i. Starting at index 0, return the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index. You can always reach the end.

**Example**:

nums = [2,3,1,1,4] → 2 (0→1→4).

nums = [2,3,0,1,4] → 2.

**Match**
Greedy / BFS-level idea. Think of the array as layers of reachable indices:

At each jump, expand the current range [l, r] (the indices reachable with current jumps).

Find the farthest index reachable from this range.

Update range to [r+1, farthest] and increment jumps.

Continue until r ≥ n-1.
