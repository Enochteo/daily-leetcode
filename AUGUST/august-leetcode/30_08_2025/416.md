## Partition Equal Subset Sum
**Understand**
We’re given an array nums. We need to decide if it can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.
Equivalent to: can we find a subset whose sum = total // 2? (only possible if total is even).

**Match**
The posted code uses DFS splitting into setA and setB, memoized by (i, sumA, sumB). This works but is inefficient because state grows large.
Optimal: reduce to subset sum problem → 0/1 knapsack style DP.
