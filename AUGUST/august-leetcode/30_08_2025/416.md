## Partition Equal Subset Sum
**Understand**
We’re given an array nums. We need to decide if it can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.
Equivalent to: can we find a subset whose sum = total // 2? (only possible if total is even).

**Match**
DFS with memoization:

At each index i, try putting nums[i] in setA or in setB.

Use a memo dictionary to avoid recomputing the same (i, setA, setB) state.

Base case: if i == len(nums), return whether setA == setB.This works but is inefficient because state grows large.
Optimal: reduce to subset sum problem → 0/1 knapsack style DP.

**Plan** (subset sum)

Initialize a memo dictionary for caching results.

Define recursive function dfs(i, setA, setB):

If (i, setA, setB) seen, return memoized result.

If i == len(nums), return whether setA == setB.

Otherwise, branch:

Add nums[i] to setA, recurse.

Or add nums[i] to setB, recurse.

Store result in memo and return.

Call dfs(0, 0, 0) as entry point.


**Implement**
```py
class Solution(object):
    def canPartition(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        memo = {}
        def dfs(i, setA, setB):
            if (i, setA, setB) in memo:
                return memo[(i, setA, setB)]
            if i == len(nums):
                if setA == setB:
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
            res = dfs(i+1, setA + nums[i], setB) or dfs(i+1, setA, setB + nums[i])
            memo[(i, setA, setB)] = res
            return res
```

**Review**

Explores all possible splits but caches overlapping subproblems to reduce recomputation.

Works correctly for small inputs but can still be heavy for large sums (since memo stores states keyed by both sums).

Doesn’t explicitly check if total sum is odd (which could short-circuit early).

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: Exponential in worst case, but memoization prunes repeated states.

Space Complexity: O(n * sum(nums)) in memo dictionary.

Correctness guaranteed, but not optimal compared to subset-sum DP.

**Pattern to remember**
For partition/equal-sum problems: DFS exploring two subset sums with memoization can work, though a more efficient approach is to target half the total sum directly.
