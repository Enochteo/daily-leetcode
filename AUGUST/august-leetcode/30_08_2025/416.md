## Partition Equal Subset Sum
**Understand**
We’re given an array nums. We need to decide if it can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.
Equivalent to: can we find a subset whose sum = total // 2? (only possible if total is even).

**Match**
The posted code uses DFS splitting into setA and setB, memoized by (i, sumA, sumB). This works but is inefficient because state grows large.
Optimal: reduce to subset sum problem → 0/1 knapsack style DP.

**Plan** (subset sum)

Compute total = sum(nums). If odd → return False.

Target = total // 2.

Use a set or boolean DP to track reachable subset sums:

Initialize dp = {0}.

For each num in nums, update dp with dp | {num+x for x in dp}.

If target in dp, return True.

Return False if end reached without target.
