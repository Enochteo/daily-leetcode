## Minimum Path Sum
**Understand**
Given an m x n grid of non-negative integers, starting at the top-left, move only right or down to reach the bottom-right. Return the minimal path sum.

**Match**
Dynamic Programming with rolling array (1D). At cell (r, c), the minimal cost is grid[r][c] + min(from_top, from_left).

**Plan**
Maintain a 1D array dp[c] representing the minimal path sum to the current rowâ€™s column c.

Initialize dp = [inf]*n, set dp[0] = 0 and accumulate the first column as you iterate rows.

For each cell, update dp[c] = grid[r][c] + min(dp[c] (from top), dp[c-1] (from left)).

Answer is dp[n-1].
