## Hand of Straights
**Understand**
We’re given an integer array hand and a group size groupSize. We must check if it’s possible to rearrange hand into groups of size groupSize where each group is a sequence of consecutive cards.

Example:

hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3 → True
(groups = [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [6,7,8])

**Match**
Greedy with frequency counts:

Sort the hand so we always try to build from the smallest card.

Use a counter to track how many of each card remain.

For each card in sorted order, if its count > 0, attempt to build a full group [card, card+1, ..., card+groupSize-1].

If any card in the required group is missing or exhausted, return False.

**Plan**

Sort the hand.

Build a Counter(hand) for card frequencies.

Iterate through sorted hand:

If counts[start] == 0, continue.

Otherwise, for j in [0..groupSize-1]:

Check if counts[start+j] > 0.

If not, return False.

Else, decrement it.

If loop completes, return True.
