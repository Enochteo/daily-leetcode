## Hand of Straights
**Understand**
We’re given an integer array hand and a group size groupSize. We must check if it’s possible to rearrange hand into groups of size groupSize where each group is a sequence of consecutive cards.

Example:

hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3 → True
(groups = [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [6,7,8])
