## Largest Number
**Understand**
Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them to form the largest possible number. Return it as a string.

Example: [10,2] → "210".

Example: [3,30,34,5,9] → "9534330".

Challenge: Usual numeric sorting doesn’t work; need a custom comparator.

**Match**
Sorting with custom comparator:

For two numbers n1, n2, compare n1+n2 vs n2+n1.

If n1+n2 > n2+n1, then n1 should come before n2.

After sorting, join the numbers.

Edge case: multiple zeros → return "0" instead of "000...".
