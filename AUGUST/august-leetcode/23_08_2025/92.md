## Reverse Linked List II
**Understand**
Given the head of a singly linked list and two positions left and right (1-indexed), reverse the list nodes from position left to right. Return the modified list.

Constraints: must do it in one pass, in-place.

**Match**
Linked list sublist reversal. Use:

A dummy node to simplify edge cases.

Iteration to advance to node before left.

Reverse exactly right-left+1 nodes.

Reconnect the reversed sublist with the rest of the list.

**Plan**

Create dummy = ListNode(0, head) to handle reversing from the head.

Move prev pointer left-1 steps so that it points to the node before the reversal segment.

start = prev.next â†’ first node of the segment to reverse.

Reverse the next right-left+1 nodes using a helper.

reverse(node, count) returns (new_head, remainder) where new_head is the head of the reversed segment and remainder is the node after it.

Reconnect:

prev.next = new_head

start.next = remainder

Return dummy.next as the new head.
