## Reverse Linked List II
**Understand**
Given the head of a singly linked list and two positions left and right (1-indexed), reverse the list nodes from position left to right. Return the modified list.

Constraints: must do it in one pass, in-place.

**Match**
Linked list sublist reversal. Use:

A dummy node to simplify edge cases.

Iteration to advance to node before left.

Reverse exactly right-left+1 nodes.

Reconnect the reversed sublist with the rest of the list.
