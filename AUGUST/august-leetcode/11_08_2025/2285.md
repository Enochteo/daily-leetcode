## Maximum Total Importance of Roads
**Understand**
You are given n cities (0 to n-1) and undirected roads. You must assign each city a unique value from 1..n.
The importance of a road (u, v) is value[u] + value[v].
Goal: maximize the total importance over all roads.

Key observation: Each city contributes its assigned value once per incident edge. If city i has degree deg[i], its contribution to total is deg[i] * value[i]. To maximize the sum, assign larger values to cities with larger degrees.

**Match**
Greedy optimization

Sorting by frequency/degree

Similar to assigning weights by sorted order to maximize dot product
