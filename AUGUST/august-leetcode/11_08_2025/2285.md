## Maximum Total Importance of Roads
**Understand**
You are given n cities (0 to n-1) and undirected roads. You must assign each city a unique value from 1..n.
The importance of a road (u, v) is value[u] + value[v].
Goal: maximize the total importance over all roads.

Key observation: Each city contributes its assigned value once per incident edge. If city i has degree deg[i], its contribution to total is deg[i] * value[i]. To maximize the sum, assign larger values to cities with larger degrees.

**Match**
Greedy optimization

Sorting by frequency/degree

Similar to assigning weights by sorted order to maximize dot product

**Plan**
Compute deg[i] for each city by counting incident edges.

Sort cities by degree ascending (or descending), and assign values 1..n so that higher degree gets higher value.

Sum road contributions using assigned values.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maximumImportance(self, n, roads):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type roads: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        deg = [0] * n
        for u, v in roads:
            deg[u] += 1
            deg[v] += 1

        order = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: deg[i])
        val = [0] * n
        for rank, city in enumerate(order):
            val[city] = rank + 1

        total = 0
        for u, v in roads:
            total += val[u] + val[v]
        return total
```
