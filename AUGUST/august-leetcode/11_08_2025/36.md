## Valid Sudoku
**Understand**
Given a 9×9 Sudoku board (partially filled with digits '1'..'9' and '.' for empty), determine if it is valid:

Each row contains no duplicates.

Each column contains no duplicates.

Each 3×3 sub-box contains no duplicates.
Empty cells '.' are ignored. You do not need to solve the Sudoku.

**Match**
Hashing / sets for duplicate detection

Grid validation by three independent passes (rows, columns, boxes)
