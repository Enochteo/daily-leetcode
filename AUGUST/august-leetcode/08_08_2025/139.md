## Word Break
**Understand**
Given a string s and a dictionary of words wordDict, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

All the words in the dictionary are non-empty and contain only lowercase letters.

We can reuse words from the dictionary multiple times.

**Match**
This is a classic Dynamic Programming + DFS problem.

You can use a Trie to optimize prefix matching.

Combine this with memoization to avoid redundant DFS calls.
