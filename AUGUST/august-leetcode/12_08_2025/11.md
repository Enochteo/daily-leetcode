## Container With Most Water
**Understand**
Given an array height where height[i] is the vertical line at coordinate i, choose two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container holding the most water. The area between lines at i and j is min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i). Return the maximum possible area.

**Match**
Two pointers from both ends, greedily shrinking the side with the shorter height to search for potentially larger areas.

**Plan**

Initialize l = 0, r = n - 1, max_area = 0.

While l < r:

Compute area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l) and update max_area.

Move the pointer at the shorter line inward (l += 1 if height[l] <= height[r], else r -= 1) to potentially find a taller side with a similar or smaller width.

Return max_area.

**Implement**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0

        while l < r:
            area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)
            if area > max_area:
                max_area = area

            if height[l] <= height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1

        return max_area
```
**Review**

Uses while l < r (safer than l != r) and removes the stray print.

Always moving the shorter side is correct: the current area is limited by the shorter height; keeping it cannot yield a larger area with a smaller width, so we must try to find a taller line on that side.
