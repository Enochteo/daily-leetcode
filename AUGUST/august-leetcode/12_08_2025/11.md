## Container With Most Water
**Understand**
Given an array height where height[i] is the vertical line at coordinate i, choose two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container holding the most water. The area between lines at i and j is min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i). Return the maximum possible area.

**Match**
Two pointers from both ends, greedily shrinking the side with the shorter height to search for potentially larger areas.
