## Summary Ranges
**Understand**
Given a sorted, unique integer array nums, return the smallest list of ranges that cover all numbers.
A range is:

"a->b" if a to b are consecutive and a < b

"a" if itâ€™s a single number

**Match**
Two-pointer / sliding window over a sorted array

Run-length compression of consecutive integers

**Plan**
Initialize index i = 0 and result list res = [].

For each run:

Set start = nums[i].

Advance i while nums[i] and nums[i+1] are consecutive.

If start != nums[i], append "start->nums[i]"; else append "start".

Move to the next index and repeat.

Return res.
