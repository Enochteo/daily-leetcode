## Summary Ranges
**Understand**
Given a sorted, unique integer array nums, return the smallest list of ranges that cover all numbers.
A range is:

"a->b" if a to b are consecutive and a < b

"a" if it’s a single number

**Match**
Two-pointer / sliding window over a sorted array

Run-length compression of consecutive integers
