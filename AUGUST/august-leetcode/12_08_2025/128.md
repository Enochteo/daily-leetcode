## Longest Consecutive Sequence
**Understand**
Given an unsorted integer array, return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. Consecutive means values differ by exactly 1 (order in the array doesn’t matter). Duplicates may appear in input but don’t extend a sequence beyond unique values.
