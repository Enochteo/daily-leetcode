## Longest Consecutive Sequence
**Understand**
Given an unsorted integer array, return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. Consecutive means values differ by exactly 1 (order in the array doesn’t matter). Duplicates may appear in input but don’t extend a sequence beyond unique values.

**Match**
Hash set + linear scan. For each value, only start counting if it is the start of a run (i.e., value−1 not present). Expand forward while value+1 exists.

**Plan**

Insert all numbers into a set for O(1) membership checks.

For each distinct value n in the set:

If n−1 not in set, this is a run start.

Walk forward n, n+1, n+2, … counting length until the chain breaks.

Maintain global maximum.

Return the maximum.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        numSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for n in numSet:
            if n - 1 not in numSet:  # start of a run
                length = 1
                curr = n
                while curr + 1 in numSet:
                    curr += 1
                    length += 1
                if length > longest:
                    longest = length

        return longest
```
**Review**

Example: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

Starts at 1 → counts 1,2,3,4 → length 4; longest = 4.

Duplicates don’t affect correctness since we iterate over a set.

Empty input returns 0 since no starts are found and longest stays 0.
