## Longest Consecutive Sequence
**Understand**
Given an unsorted integer array, return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. Consecutive means values differ by exactly 1 (order in the array doesn’t matter). Duplicates may appear in input but don’t extend a sequence beyond unique values.

**Match**
Hash set + linear scan. For each value, only start counting if it is the start of a run (i.e., value−1 not present). Expand forward while value+1 exists.

**Plan**

Insert all numbers into a set for O(1) membership checks.

For each distinct value n in the set:

If n−1 not in set, this is a run start.

Walk forward n, n+1, n+2, … counting length until the chain breaks.

Maintain global maximum.

Return the maximum.
