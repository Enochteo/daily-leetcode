## Longest Common Prefix
**Understand**
You are given an array of strings. Find the longest common prefix among all strings.

If no common prefix exists, return an empty string.

All strings are lowercase, and length â‰¤ 200.

**Match**
Standard Trie problem where a prefix is shared across strings.

Efficient use of a Trie to insert the shortest string and use it as the base for comparisons.

Prefix comparison is optimized by limiting the prefix length iteratively.

**Plan**
Edge case: If there's only one string, return it.

Find the shortest string since the common prefix can't be longer than this.

Insert the shortest string into a Trie.

Iterate through each string and compute the longest common prefix using a helper function lcp.

Return the prefix of the shortest word up to the common length.
