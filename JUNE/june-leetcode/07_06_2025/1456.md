## Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length
**Understand:**
The problem is to find and return the number of vowels in a substring (of length k) in the input string with the maximum number of vowels.
Input: a string s, substring length k
Output: the number of vowels in a substring of length k which has the most vowels
Edge cases: 
- No vowels in the string -> return 0
- all vowels in string -> return length of string
- empty string -> return 0

**Match**
This is a sliding window problem. We are looking for the max number of vowels in each window of length k in the string s.

**Plan**
1. Store the vowels in a set for quick access.
2. Maintain a sliding window of length k
- Find the number of vowels in the first window and store that as the max number.
- then we slide the window and update the max number if we encounter a larger number of vowels.
3. return the max number

**Implement**
- Create a set to store the vowels
- iterate over the first k characters in the string
- store the number of vowels as the max number of vowels
- now iterate from k to the end of the string but in the iteration you slide the window by:
    - if you encounter a vowel, increment count and if the left (i-k) is a vowel decrement count
    - update the max number of vowels with the new count
- return the new count

Evaluate:
Time complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
