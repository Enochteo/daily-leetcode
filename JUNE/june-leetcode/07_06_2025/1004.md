## Max Consecutive Ones III
**Understand**
The problem is to return the maximum number of consecutive 1s you can get after flipping at most k zeros
Input: An array of 0s and 1s, A number k, which is the maximum number of 0s we can flip to 1s.
Output: the maximum number of consecutive 1s you can get after flipping at most k zeros

**Match**
This is a sliding window problem where:
The window contains at most k zeros.
We’re looking for the maximum size of such a valid window.

**Plan**
Use a Sliding Window:
Keep two pointers: left and right.

Move right to extend the window.

For each 0 at right, use 1 flip (reduce k).

If k < 0: we’ve used more than k flips. Move left to shrink the window until it becomes valid again (flip count ≤ k).

At each step, update the maximum length (right - left + 1).

**Implement**
- create a left pointer and max length setting them to zero
- iterate using a pointer (right) to the length of the string
    - decrement k if nums of right = 0
    - while k < 0, : 
        - if the nums of left was flipped (= 0) increment k 
        - shift the left window
    - update the max length
- return max_length

Evaluate:
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)
