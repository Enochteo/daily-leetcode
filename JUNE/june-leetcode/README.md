## Daily Leetcode Practice
This repo contains my daily leetcode solution bank as well as UMPIRE approach used to come across this solutions. I am using this space to sharpen my problem-solving skills, improve coding efficiency and prepare for technical interviews.

### Goals
- Practice data structures and algorithms consistently.
- Build a strong foundation for coding assessments.
- Track my progress over time.
I am trying to attain to solve 5 leetcode questions a day except days when I have important events and can't solve 5.
- So for a bit I would change the aim from solving 5 new questions a day, reason being according to precious navdip singh quality is better than quantity. I feel I have solved probably enough questions on the topics I know very well, now I want to go into reviewing stage where I go back to these questions and then see whether I can solve them on my own. 

## Question Difficulty
Majority of the questions would be of Medium difficulty
