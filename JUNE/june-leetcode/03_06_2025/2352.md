## Equal Row and Column Pairs — UMPIRE Strategy
 Understand the Problem
Given a square n x n grid, count how many row-column pairs are exactly equal (element-wise).

Match the Problem Type
This is a 2D array traversal and dictionary counting problem. We're matching sequences (rows vs columns).


P — Plan a Solution
Store each row as a tuple in a dictionary with its count.

Transpose the grid using zip(*grid) to access columns.

For each column tuple, if it exists in the row dictionary, add its count to the result.

I — Implement the Code
Used plain dictionary (rc) to store row counts. Loop through columns, check for matches, and sum up.


R — Review the Solution
Time complexity: O(n²)

Space: O(n²) for storing row tuples

Correctly handles multiple identical rows/columns

E — Evaluate Edge Cases
Grid with all equal values

Grid with no matches

Empty grid or 1x1 grid
