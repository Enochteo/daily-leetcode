## Leetcode 144 & 145
Solved two bonus questions on binary trees.
Preorder and Postorder Traversal.

Preorder:
Perform operation -> Recursively call on left subtree -> Recursively call on right subtree.

Postorder:
Recursively call left subtree -> Recursively call right right subtree -> perform operation.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(N)
