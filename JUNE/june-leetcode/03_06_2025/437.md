## Path Sum III - Medium*
## Leetcode 75

Understand
The problem was to count the number of paths whose sum equals the target. The path could be anywhere not necessarily from root to leaf.

Match
The problem is a binary tree problem. You also need understanding helper functioning.

Plan
The plan is to perform a dfs on a node and then for each pass check if the sum reaches the target sum. I would need a function for the dfs and in that would call a checker for the targetSum. Then perform a dfs on the children and do the same.

Implement
- Create a global count variable
- perform a dfs on the root node
- in each dfs, pass into a test function
- for each test check if the value equals the targetsum
- Recursively Test for the children, but for each test reduce the targetSum by the root's value

Evaluation
- Time Complexity: Worst case - O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
