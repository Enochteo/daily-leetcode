## Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree - Medium
Understand
The problem is to find all zigzag paths in a binary tree and return the length of the longest one. 

Match
The problem is a binary tree problem, with dfs.

Plan
The plan is to to perform dfs to get each path length, we would pass the current length for each pass as well as the previous direction and then reverse the direction we move each pass. If we come across a leaf or a none for the opposite direction we start the length again passing in 1 as the length. Also for each pass we update the max_length if we have a larger length, then we return the max_length.
