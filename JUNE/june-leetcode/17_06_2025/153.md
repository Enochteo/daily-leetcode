## Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
(https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

Given a rotated sorted array with no duplicates, find the minimum
element in **O(log n)** time.

#### **Understand**
We are given a sorted array that's been rotated at some unknown pivot.
Our task is to return the smallest element in this array.
- Input: An array of integers `nums` (sorted and rotated).
- Output: The **minimum element** in the array.
- Constraint: Must run in **O(log n)** time.

Example:
`nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` → output: `0`

#### **Match**
This is a classic **Binary Search** problem disguised in rotation.
The Array is partially sorted and the goal is to find a special value using **logarithmic time** ->
suggests Binary Search.


#### **Plan**
1. Initialize two pointers: `l = 0`, `r = len(nums) - 1`.
2. While `l < r`, compute the mid index.
3. Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[r]`:
   - If `nums[mid] > nums[r]`, the minimum must be in the **right half** -> `l = mid + 1`.
   - Else, the minimum is in the **left half (or at mid)** -> `r = mid`.
4. Loop ends when `l == r`. Return `nums[l]`.

#### **Implement**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMin(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[r]:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid
        return nums[l]
```

#### **Review**

The Solution handles all edge cases (e.g., no rotation, only two elements).

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

#### **Evaluate & Explain**

Efficiency: Achieves logarithmic performance by halving the search
space each step.

Robustness: Works even if the minimum is at index 0 or at the rotation point.

Learnings: This problem reinforced the idea that binary search isn't
just for exact matches — it can find properties (like the minimum)
using ordered structure.
