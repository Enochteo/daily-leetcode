## Reverse Linked List (Recursive Approach)
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the new head. This version solves the problem using a recursive approach.

**Understand**
We are given a singly linked list and must reverse its node order.

Input: Head of a singly linked list

Output: New head of the reversed list

Constraints:

Must reverse the list by modifying the .next pointers

No new nodes should be created

Example:
Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`
Output:`5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`

**Match**
This is a classic linked list problem.
Recursion is well-suited for problems with natural substructure like:

Recurse to the end

Perform actions while the stack unwinds

**Plan**
Base case: If the list is empty or has one node, return head.

Recurse on the rest of the list: reverseList(head.next).

On returning, reverse the pointer:

`head.next.next = head`

`head.next = None`

Return the new head from the base case.

**Implement**
```python
class ListNode(object):
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        
        new_head = self.reverseList(head.next)
        head.next.next = head
        head.next = None
        
        return new_head
```

**Evaluate**
Handles edge cases like:

Empty list (head = None)

Single-node list

Already reversed input

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) due to recursion stack
