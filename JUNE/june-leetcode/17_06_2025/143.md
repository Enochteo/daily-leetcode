## Reorder List
https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

Given the head of a singly linked list, reorder it in-place such that
the nodes are rearranged in this specific order:
`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → ...`
Do not return anything — modify the list in-place.

#### Understand
We were given a singly linked list.
Our goal is to reorder its nodes by alternating from the front and
back, without creating new nodes or using extra space.

**Input**: head of the list

**Output**: Reordered list, in-place

**Constraints**:
Do not use extra space
Only modify .next pointers
Return type is None

**Example**:
Input: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
Output: 1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3

### Match
This is a linked list manipulation problem involving:
Middle detection using slow/fast pointers
Reversing a sublist
Merging two lists in-place
No extra memory is allowed → O(1) space → suggests pointer manipulation.

### Plan
Use slow and fast pointers to find the middle node.

Reverse the second half of the list starting after the middle.

Merge the first half and the reversed second half, alternating nodes.

Set the last node's .next to None to terminate the list.

### Implement

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reorderList(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: None
        """
        if not head:
            return

        # Step 1: Find the middle
        slow = head
        fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # Step 2: Reverse the second half
        prev = None
        current = slow.next
        while current:
            temp = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = temp
        slow.next = None  # cut the list

        # Step 3: Merge the two halves
        first = head
        second = prev
        while second:
            tmp1 = first.next
            tmp2 = second.next

            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1

            first = tmp1
            second = tmp2
```
### Evaluate

This solution handles edge cases:

Odd and even number of nodes

Two-node list

Already ordered or reversed lists

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Efficiency: Uses only pointer manipulation — no extra lists or arrays.
Robustness: Resilient to all list sizes and handles mid-point
calculations precisely.
Learnings: A great example of combining common techniques — slow/fast
pointers, reversing, and merging — into one clean in-place algorithm.
