## Longest Repeating Character Replacement
**Understand**
The problem is to return the length of the longest substring in a string with repeating characters if you can only swap k characters in the substring.

Input: "AABAAABB", k = 1
Outpu:  6, you swap the first B to an A

**Match**
The problem involves sliding window with hash table to store the repeating char frequency and also so we don't have to check substrings of chars we have already checked for.

**Plan**
- we would use a sliding window
- we would slide the right if we repeating characters or if not we decrement k.
- we slide the left if we find a  non-repeating and k is done
- we then return the length of the largest window

**Implement**
- Initialize the hash table and sliding window
- increment the hash table for eachcharacter if its repeating or we still have k
- while we dont have a repeating and also k, we decrement the hash table and slide the left window.
     the way we could check if we dont have repeating characters and k is if the length of the current window minus the max number of the most occuring values is greater than k.
- we update the maxlength if we find a longer window length.
- return the maxlength.

**Evaluate**
- Time complexity: O(N)
- Space commplexity: O(N) worst case
