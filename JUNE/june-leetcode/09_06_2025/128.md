## Longest Consecutive Sequence - Neetcode 150 Medium
**Understand**
The problem is to return the length of the longest run/sequence of consecutive numbers in a list.
Input: a list of numbers e.g [1,2,3,5,6,8,9]
Ouput: the length of the largest sequence of consecutive numbers: 1,2,3 -> 3

**Match**
The problem involves hash sets and arrays

**Plan**
- we use a set for o(1) look up and count for every consecutive number after the current number exists and return the max length also while preventing counting duplicates for efficiency.

**Implement**
- we convert the list into a set for O(1) lookup
- we iterate over the list.
To prevent duplicate checks we make sure the previous consecutive number (num -1) is not in the set before we start checking
- we then check while each consecutive number from that number is in the set we do this by (num + 1) in set, then we increment the count and then increment the num
- return the max count

**Evaluate**
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(N) extra set
