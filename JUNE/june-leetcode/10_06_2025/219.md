## Contain Duplicate II 
**Understand**
The problem is an extension of Contains duplicate one. We are to return a boolean on whther there exists and duplicate and if the duplicate position satisfy these conditions -> abs(i - j)

Input: [1,2,3,1] k=3
Output: True

**Match**
The problem is an array question. Also involves knowledge of hashmaps or sliding window.

**Plan**
A brute force way is using a two-pointer nested for loop solution. But just like always is O(N^2). 
An optimized solution is using an hash map to store visited numbers and then check each for duplicates in the hash map (O(1)) and then also check the condition.

**Implement**
- Initialize the hash map
- iterate over the nums
- check if it is in seen and if the condition is true. Then return true
- else add to the hash map
- return False

**Evaluate**
- Time Complexity -> O(N)
- Space complexity -> O(N)
