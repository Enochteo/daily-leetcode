## Intersection of 2 linked lists
I used the same approach as intersection of normal list.
Add first to a set, if second in the first return it.

But it could be optimized better (space-wise) by using two-pointer. One for each list, once you reach the end of one point to the next. if they ever become equal, they intersect.
