## Detect Cycle in Linked List
I first tried using a list to store visited nodes and then checking to see duplicate values. This was wrong for 2 reasons. 
1. You are meant to check duplicate nodes and not values (to do: make sure you ask and clarify from interviewer and understand the question fully)
2. Checking a list is O(n) time complexity I could have used a set (O(1))

I also thought of a recursive approach, this works with the nodes but has potential of stack overflow 
with long lists according to GPT

Optimized solution:
Floyd's Algorithm
This just means using two pointers a fast and slow and checking if theyre ever equal (you can also use this to find the middle element)
