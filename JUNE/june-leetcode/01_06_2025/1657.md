## Continuation of Leetcode 75
## Determine if Two Strings are close * - Medium
First you generate hashtables for both words.
Then you check both operations simultaneously.
For the first operation just check if the sorted form of both table values are equal.
For the second step check convert both table keys into sets and check if they're equal. 
Reason: This is because sets do not care about order or duplicity so if they are the same characters but scattered both sets would be equal.
