## Continuation of Leetcode 75
## Determine if Two Strings are close * - Medium
**Understand**
We are given two strings word1 and word2. You can perform two operations:

Swap any two existing characters.

Transform every occurrence of one character into another existing character (you must also transform the target character back).

You need to determine if word1 can be transformed into word2 using only these operations.
