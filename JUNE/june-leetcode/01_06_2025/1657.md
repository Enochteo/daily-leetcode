## Continuation of Leetcode 75
## Determine if Two Strings are close * - Medium
**Understand**
We are given two strings word1 and word2. You can perform two operations:

Swap any two existing characters.

Transform every occurrence of one character into another existing character (you must also transform the target character back).

You need to determine if word1 can be transformed into word2 using only these operations.

**Match**
This is a frequency and character identity problem.

Key insight: You can only rearrange characters and swap frequencies.

Conditions for word1 to be close to word2:

The set of characters in both strings must match (you can’t transform into or from a character that doesn’t exist).

The frequency of character counts must be rearrangeable (so, frequency multisets must match).

**Plan**
If the lengths differ, return False.

Use Counter to get character frequencies for both strings.

Compare:

Set of characters (keys of counters).

Sorted list of frequencies (values of counters).
