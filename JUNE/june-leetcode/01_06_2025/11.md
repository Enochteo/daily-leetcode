## Continuation of Leetcode 75
## 11. Container with most water - Medium
**Understand**
You are given an array height where each element represents the height of a vertical line on the x-axis. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container such that the container contains the most water.

You must return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Match**
Two Pointer technique is suitable.

Goal is to maximize area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l).

Greedy strategy: Always move the pointer pointing to the shorter line.

**Plan**
Initialize two pointers: l = 0, r = len(height) - 1.

While l < r:

Compute the area: min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l).

Update max_area if current area is larger.

Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward (since it limits the height).
