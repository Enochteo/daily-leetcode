## Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree
Understand:
The problem says to check each level of a binary tree and return the level with the maximum sum

Match:
This involves a binary tree with a specificity on Level Order Traversal

Plan:
- Perform a level order traversal
- Create a list for each level and add the elements of the level
- check the sum against a maximum sum (make sure you initialize your sum to negative infinity because you could have negative numbers in your test cases). Increment a level pointer for each level
- Return the level pointer of the max_level (starting from 1)

Evaluate:
