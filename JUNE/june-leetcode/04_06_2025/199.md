## Binary Tree Right side view - Medium

Understand:
The question says to return the values we would see if we viewed a binary tree from the right side.

Match:
The question is a binary tree question -> Breadth first search. With specificity on Level order Traversal and list manipulation.

Plan:
The plan is to perform a level order traversal, and for each level add the last index into a new list, which we now return

Implement:
- Perform a level order traversal the normal way
- The catch is that in the for loop, when we get to the last index we append the value to a new list
- Return the right side list

Evaluate:
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N) :(
