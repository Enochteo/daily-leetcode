Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
This project reconstructs a binary tree given its preorder and inorder traversal sequences. The tree is built using a recursive approach that leverages the traversal properties and efficiently constructs left and right subtrees.

**Understand**
Given two lists:

preorder: Nodes visited in root → left → right order

inorder: Nodes visited in left → root → right order

You need to construct the original binary tree and return its root node.

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

Divide and conquer in trees

Recursive tree construction

Traversal-based binary tree logic

Use of deque for efficient O(1) pops from preorder


**Plan**
Convert preorder list into a deque for efficient popping.

Define a recursive function constructor(preorder, inorder):

If inorder is empty, return None.

The first value in preorder is always the root.

Find the root's index in inorder.

Slice inorder into left and right subtrees using this index.

Recurse for left and right using updated inorder slices.

Return the fully constructed tree from the helper.


**Implement**
```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution(object):
    def buildTree(self, preorder, inorder):
        """
        :type preorder: List[int]
        :type inorder: List[int]
        :rtype: Optional[TreeNode]
        """
        preorder = deque(preorder)
        
        def constructor(preorder, inorder):
            if inorder:
                index = inorder.index(preorder.popleft())
                root = TreeNode(inorder[index])
                root.left = constructor(preorder, inorder[:index])
                root.right = constructor(preorder, inorder[index+1:])
                return root
        
        return constructor(preorder, inorder)
```
**Review**
The deque ensures efficient front removal during recursion.

Recursive calls divide the inorder list into correct left/right subtrees.

The function correctly handles edge cases (e.g. empty trees).

Clean and concise recursive tree construction with slicing.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity:

Average case: O(n²) due to repeated .index() lookup in inorder

Can be optimized to O(n) with a hashmap to avoid repeated searches

Space Complexity:

O(n) for recursion stack and slicing of inorder
