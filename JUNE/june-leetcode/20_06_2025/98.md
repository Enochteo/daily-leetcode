##  Validate Binary Search Tree
This question asks to check whether a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). A valid BST satisfies the property that every node’s value must be greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree.

The solution uses a recursive depth-first search (DFS) strategy while maintaining bounds (min < node.val < max) for each node.

**Understand**
You are given the root of a binary tree. Determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

In a valid BST:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.

- The right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

- Both the left and right subtrees must also be valid BSTs.

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

- Tree traversal (DFS)

- Bounds checking at each node

- Recursive validation based on constraints

**Plan**
- Use DFS to traverse the tree.

- Maintain two bounds: left and right.

- For each node, check that left < node.val < right.

- Recursively apply the same logic:

    - For the left child, update the right bound to node.val.

    - For the right child, update the left bound to node.val.

- Return True only if all nodes satisfy the BST conditions.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValidBST(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def checker(root, left, right):
            if not root:
                return True
            if not (left < root.val < right):
                return False
            return checker(root.left, left, root.val) and checker(root.right, root.val, right)
        
        return checker(root, float('-inf'), float('inf'))
```

**Review**
The function checker ensures that each node’s value falls within valid bounds.

It recursively narrows the allowed range for each subtree.

The use of float('-inf') and float('inf') sets initial unrestricted bounds.

The solution is concise and correctly handles all edge cases.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree (each node is visited once).

Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).

Worst case: O(n) for skewed trees

Best case: O(log n) for balanced trees
