## Koko Eating Bananas Neetcode 15
**Understand**
Koko loves bananas and has piles of bananas, each pile containing piles[i] bananas. She eats at a constant speed of k bananas/hour. She has h hours to eat all the bananas.
You need to find the minimum integer speed k such that she can eat all the bananas in h hours.

Key constraints:
She can only eat from one pile per hour.
She always eats exactly k bananas/hour (or the remaining pile if it’s smaller than k).
You return the smallest possible k such that all bananas are eaten in h hours.

**Match**
Search problem over a range -> Binary Search is appropriate

You are searching for the minimum speed k such that a condition is true (Koko eats all in ≤ h hours)

This is a classic binary search on answer space problem


**Plan**
The minimum eating speed is at least 1 (can’t be 0).

The maximum eating speed is max(piles) (if she eats a whole pile in 1 hour).

Use binary search to find the smallest k for which the total hours taken ≤ h.

Steps:

Set l = 1 and r = max(piles)

While l <= r:

Try mid = (l + r) // 2 as the eating speed

Compute hours needed to eat all piles at that speed

If hours <= h, it's a valid speed; try to find smaller → move r = mid - 1

If hours > h, speed is too slow → move l = mid + 1

Return the minimum valid speed found.

**Implement**
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        l = 1
        r = max(piles)
        res = r
        while l <= r:
            speed = (l + r) // 2
            hours = 0
            for pile in piles:
                hours += math.ceil(pile / speed)
            if hours <= h:
                res = speed
                r = speed - 1
            else:
                l = speed + 1
        return res

**Review**
Why Binary Search Works:
You're looking for the minimum speed where a condition is met. When you find a valid speed (i.e., hours ≤ h), you don’t stop — you try to go even smaller. This classic binary search pattern ensures you get the lowest valid k.

Intuition Check:

If speed is too low, total hours go up

If speed is too high, hours go down, but you may overshoot minimum

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity:

Binary search range is log(max(piles))

For each binary search step, you loop over n = len(piles) to compute hours

Total time: O(n * log(max(piles)))

Space Complexity: O(1) — only a few variables used
