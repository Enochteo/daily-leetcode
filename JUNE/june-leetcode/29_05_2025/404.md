## Sum of Left leaves
Run a dfs but for each node run, pass a flag for whether or not it is a left node. When this is true and it hits a leaf return the value. 
For the dfs return right with false and left with true and add them (to backtrack)
At the initial function call the dfs with false coz the head is not a leaf
