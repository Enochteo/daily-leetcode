## Longest Palindrome
Create a counter hashmap for the string.
add all even counts to the result. But for the odd add it minus 1. This is because we can only have one middle element. 
Then at the end, the result could be less or equal the initial length of strings, if it is less add 1 for the middle we missed. If it is equal it means it consists of only even counts of letters so just return the result.
