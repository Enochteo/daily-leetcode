## Palindrome Linked List
First solution was to iterate over the linked list and append to an array and check if it is a palindrome either by reversing or using two pointer inwardly


Problem:
This approach has an O(n) space complexity

Optimizing to O(1):
We use two pointer twice
the first time to get the middle of the linked list (using fast and slow)
Then from the middle to the end we reverse the list using (Reverse Linked list mechanism) - list 2

list 1 is the original list
Then we check inwardly if both lists are equal until list 2 is exhausted
