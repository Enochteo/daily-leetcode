## Different Ways to Add Parentheses
Given a string expression of numbers and operators, return all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators with parentheses.

**Understand**
You're given an arithmetic expression string containing:

Numbers (only non-negative integers)

Operators: +, -, and *

Your task is to:

Return all possible results from different valid ways of grouping the expression with parentheses.


**Match**
This is a:

Divide and Conquer problem

Requires recursion to split expression at every operator

Classic example of backtracking + memoization (optional for optimization)

**Plan**
Loop through the expression:

Whenever you see an operator, split the expression into left and right parts.

Recursively compute all possible results for the left and right subexpressions.

Combine the results from left and right using the current operator.

If there are no operators in the current substring, convert it to an integer.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def diffWaysToCompute(self, expression):
        """
        :type expression: str
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        operation = {
            "+": lambda x, y: x + y,
            "-": lambda x, y: x - y,
            "*": lambda x, y: x * y
        }

        def backtrack(left, right):
            res = []
            for i in range(left, right + 1):
                op = expression[i]
                if op in operation:
                    nums1 = backtrack(left, i - 1)
                    nums2 = backtrack(i + 1, right)
                    for n1 in nums1:
                        for n2 in nums2:
                            res.append(operation[op](n1, n2))
            if not res:
                res.append(int(expression[left:right + 1]))
            return res

        return backtrack(0, len(expression) - 1)
```
**Review**
Recursively splits expression at every operator.

Combines sub-results using valid operator applications.

Covers all permutations of valid parenthetical groupings.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: Exponential in nature – O(2ⁿ) in worst case due to all possible groupings
Space Complexity: O(2ⁿ) for recursion stack and result list
