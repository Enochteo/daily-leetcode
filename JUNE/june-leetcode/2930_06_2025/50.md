## Pow(x, n)
Implement the function to calculate x raised to the power n (i.e., compute xⁿ), where x is a float and n is an integer.

**Understand**
You're given:

A base x, which is a floating-point number.

An exponent n, which is an integer (can be positive, zero, or negative).

Return the value of xⁿ.

**Match**
This is a: Divide and Conquer problem
Either recursive or iterative approach would work.

**Plan**
Case 1: Positive Exponent (n ≥ 0)

Use recursion with exponentiation by squaring:

x^n = x^(n//2) * x^(n//2) if n is even

x^n = x * x^(n//2) * x^(n//2) if n is odd

Case 2: Negative Exponent

Convert to positive, compute normally, and invert:

x^(-n) = 1 / x^n

Base Cases:

If n == 0, return 1

If n == 1, return x

If n == -1, return 1/x

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def myPow(self, x, n):
        """
        :type x: float
        :type n: int
        :rtype: float
        """
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        if n < 0:
            x = 1 / x
            n = -n
        
        res = self.myPow(x, n // 2)
        res *= res
        return res if n % 2 == 0 else x * res
```
**Review**
The recursion is optimized by halving n each time → logarithmic depth.

Negative powers are safely handled by converting and inverting.

Avoids using floating-point division more than necessary.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(log n)

Each recursive call halves n, so depth is log₂(n)

Space Complexity: O(log n)

Due to recursive call stack (can be optimized to O(1) with iteration)
