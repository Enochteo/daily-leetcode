## House Robber II Problem
**Understand**
You are a robber planning to rob houses along a circular street, where each house contains some non-negative amount of money.
The constraint is that adjacent houses cannot be robbed, and the first and last houses are also adjacent due to the circular arrangement.

Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.

**Example**:
Input: nums = [2, 3, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob both house 1 and house 3, so the optimal choice is to rob house 2 only.

**Match**
This is a Dynamic Programming problem.
It builds on the original House Robber problem but adds the constraint of the first and last houses being adjacent.
The solution is to treat it as two separate linear problems:

Rob house 1 to n−1 (exclude last house)

Rob house 2 to n (exclude first house)
Take the maximum of the two.

**Plan**
If there’s only one house, return its value.

Define a helper function robber() to apply the standard DP logic on a linear list of houses.

Call robber(nums[1:]) (exclude first) and robber(nums[:-1]) (exclude last).

Return the maximum of the two.

Inside robber():

Create a DP array to store the max robbed value up to each house.

At each step, choose between robbing the current house + dp[i-2] or skipping and taking dp[i-1].

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return nums[0] if nums else 0

        def robber(arr):
            dp = [0] * len(arr)
            if len(arr) <= 1:
                return arr[0]
            for i in range(len(arr)):
                if i == 0:
                    dp[i] = arr[i]
                elif i == 1:
                    dp[i] = max(arr[i], arr[0])
                else:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[i] + dp[i-2])
            return dp[-1]

        return max(robber(nums[1:]), robber(nums[:-1]))
```

**Review**
Correctly handles the circular constraint by splitting into two cases

Includes edge case handling for short lists

Uses helper function for clarity and reusability

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of houses

Space Complexity: O(n), due to the DP array (can be optimized to O(1) using two variables)

Covers all edge cases, including when nums has length 0, 1, or 2
