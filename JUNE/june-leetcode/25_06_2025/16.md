## 3Sum Closest Problem
**Understand**
You are given an array of integers nums and a target integer target.
Your task is to find the sum of three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
You must return the closest sum. There is exactly one solution.

**Example**:
Input: nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2 (−1 + 2 + 1 = 2)

**Match**
This is a Two-Pointer + Sorting problem, related to the 3Sum family of problems.
The core idea is to:

Fix one number

Use two pointers to scan the rest of the array for the other two numbers

Track the sum that is closest to the target

**Plan**
Sort the input array to allow two-pointer traversal.

Initialize total as the sum of the first three numbers (best guess so far).

Loop over the array with index i:

Use two pointers, l and r, starting at i + 1 and end.

Calculate three_sum = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r].

If this sum is closer to the target than total, update total.

If the three_sum is greater than target, move r left to reduce the sum.

If three_sum is less than target, move l right to increase the sum.

If it's an exact match, return it immediately.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        nums.sort()
        total = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]

        for i, first in enumerate(nums):
            l = i + 1
            r = len(nums) - 1

            while l < r:
                three_sum = first + nums[l] + nums[r]
                if abs(three_sum - target) < abs(total - target):
                    total = three_sum
                if three_sum > target:
                    r -= 1
                elif three_sum < target:
                    l += 1
                else:
                    return three_sum
        return total
```

**Review**
Handles all array lengths ≥ 3

Uses two-pointer traversal effectively after sorting

Returns early if an exact match is found

Correctly tracks and updates the closest sum

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n²), where n is the length of the array (due to nested loop)

Space Complexity: O(1), no extra space used beyond variables
