## Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List - Medium
## Leetcode 75

Understand:
The question says to match a node with its twin. According to the formula a twin of a node is its mirror node from reverse. All nodes before the middle of a list have a twin.

Match:
This is a linked list problem.

Plan:
Brute: we would convert the list into an array and then return the max twin sums
Optimized: Reverse the nodes from the middle to the end. Then we add the values of each corresponding/respective node except the middle and return the maxSum.

Immplement:
- we find the middle of the list.
- reverse the list from there till the end
- add to its twin easily and return its max sum.

Evaluate:
- Time complexity: O(N)- optimized, O(N + N/2) - O(N)- Brute.
- Space complexity: O(1)- optimized, O(N)- brute
