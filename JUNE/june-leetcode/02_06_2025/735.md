## Asteroid Collision - Medium
### Leetcode 75

Understand
We are to check for possible asteroid collisions and determine what happens. A collision can only occur if the previous asteroid was moving in the right direction and the next one is moving in the left direction.

Match
This problem is a stack problem because we would be dealing with either pushing or removing at the last index depending on the state.

Plan:
- Push to the stack
- Check the condition for collision to know whether to pop or push to the stack of asteroids
- return the stack.


Implement:
- for each asteroid:
    - check if the last asteroid is going to the right and the next is going to the left -> for each of that:
        - keep whichever has a bigger magnitude (if its the next pop then continue), if theyre equal just pop
        - break
    if there is no possibility of collision or the stack is empty append an asteroid to the stack.
- return the stack which shows the state of the asteroids.

- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space complexity: O(N)
