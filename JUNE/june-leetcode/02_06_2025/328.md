## Odd Even Linked List - Medium
### Leetcode 75 
Understand:
The question says to group all odd indices together and all even indices together and return the new list.

Match:
This is a linked list problem.

Plan:
We are going to disconnect the nodes connect the even-indexed nodes, connect the odd-indexed nodes, then connect the end of the odd indexed nodes to the beginning of the even-indexed nodes.

Implement:
- Get the eveen and odd pointers
- store the head of the even list
- disconnect both pointers and connect it by skipping one following node.
- Connect the tail of the odd pointer to the head of the even pointer.

Evaluate:
- Time complexity: O(N)
- space complexity: O(1)
