## Find the Duplicate Number
**Understand**
You are given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number, but it may be repeated more than once.
Your goal is to return the duplicate number, without modifying the array (ideally) and using constant extra space.

**Match**
This problem is about finding duplicates under constraints:

Values are constrained to [1, n] â€” this suggests index-based strategies or cycle detection.

The simplest method is to sort the list and look for two adjacent equal numbers.

Your current solution:

Sorts the array and then compares each element to its next.

Returns the first value where nums[i] == nums[i+1].

**Plan**
Sort the input array.

Loop through the array.

If the current element is equal to the next one, return it as the duplicate.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicate(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):  # Avoid IndexError
            if nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:
                return nums[i]
```

**Review**
Example:
`Input: [1, 3, 4, 2, 2] `
`Output: 2`
Edge Cases:

The duplicate is at the end or beginning.

The number appears more than twice.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting.

Space Complexity: O(1) if sorting is done in place.

Pros: Simple and readable.

Cons: Modifies the array, which violates constraints in some interview settings.

**Note**
If the problem specifies do not modify the array and use constant space, a better solution would be:

Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (cycle detection in a linked-list-like structure formed by indexes).
