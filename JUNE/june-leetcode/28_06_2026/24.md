## Swap Nodes in Pairs
This algorithm recursively swaps every two adjacent nodes in a singly linked list and returns its head.

**Understand**
Youâ€™re given the head of a singly linked list. Swap every two adjacent nodes and return the new head. You must do this in-place (by reassigning .next pointers), and you may not modify the values in the list.

**Example**:

Input:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4  
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3

**Match**
This problem matches:

Linked List manipulation

Recursion or iteration

**Plan**
Base Case:
If the list is empty or has only one node, return head as is.

Recursive Step:

Store the second node (head.next) as next_.

Store the node after the second (head.next.next) as temp.

Recursively call swapPairs(temp) and attach it to head.next.

Rewire next_ to point to head, thus swapping the pair.

Return next_ as the new head after the swap.

**Implement**
```python
def swapPairs(self, head):
    """
    :type head: Optional[ListNode]
    :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
    """
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head

    temp = head.next.next
    next_ = head.next
    head.next.next = head
    head.next = self.swapPairs(temp)
    return next_
```

**Review**
Recursive implementation is clean and elegant.

Base case prevents null pointer errors.

No additional data structures are used.
