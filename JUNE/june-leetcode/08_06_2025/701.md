## Insert into a binary search tree
**Understand**:
The problem is to insert a value correctly into its right position in an already made binary search tree.
Input: The root of an already made binary search tree, Value to be inputed
Outpu: The root of the resulting binary tree after the value has been correctly inputed.

**Match**:
The problem involves knowledge from binary search trees, traversals and getting the leftmost value of a subtree.

**Plan**:
- The plan would be to traverse the tree recursively till you get to the correct leaf. The idea is to use the principle from binary search to get to the correct leaf.
- After this we return the root to be inputed into its correct position: left or right as determined by the binary search.

**Implement**:
- If the root is none (we get to a leaf), we return the node with the val equaling the value we were given.
- if the value is left less than the root, we assign the left of the root to the value of the recursive call on left
- else we assign the right of the root to the value o the recursive call on right
- then we return the root the whole tree.

**Review**:
- Time Complexity: O(log(n))
- Space Complexity: O(log(n))
