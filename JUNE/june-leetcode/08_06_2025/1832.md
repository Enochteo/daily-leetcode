## Check if the Sentence is Pangram
Understand:
The problem asks us to check if the input string is a pangram. This means to check if the sting contains all the letters of the alphabet

Match:
The problem involves knowledge of hash sets.

Plan:
- The plan is to use a set to store all the letters of the alphabet and all the letters in the string and check if they have the same length, because a set does not allow for duplicates, if it is a pangram it has to be a duplicate.

Implement:
- Put the letters in the input into a set
- return whether or not its length is greater than or equal to 26.

Evaluate:
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space complexity: O(1)
