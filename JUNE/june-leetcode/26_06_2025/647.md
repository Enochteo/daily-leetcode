## Count Palindromic Substrings
**Understand**
You are given a string s.
Your task is to count how many substrings of s are palindromes.
A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.
Substrings with different start or end positions are considered different.

Example:
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings "a", "b", and "c" are palindromes.
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: All substrings are palindromes: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa"

**Match**
This is a Two-Pointer Expansion problem often used for finding palindromes.
The idea is to expand around centers and count valid palindromic substrings.

**Plan**
Initialize a result variable to store the count.

Define a helper function palindrome_counter(s, l, r) that:

Expands as long as s[l] == s[r] and both are within bounds

Adds 1 to a local counter for each valid palindrome

Loop over every index i in the string:

Count odd-length palindromes centered at i

Count even-length palindromes centered between i and i+1

Add the results to the global count.

Return the total count.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def countSubstrings(self, s):
        result = 0

        def palindrome_counter(s, l, r):
            total = 0
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                total += 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1
            return total

        for i in range(len(s)):
            result += palindrome_counter(s, i, i)     # odd length
            result += palindrome_counter(s, i, i + 1) # even length

        return result
```
**Review**
Correctly handles both even and odd length palindromes

Efficiently counts palindromes in a single traversal

Covers edge cases (single character, repeated characters)

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) in the worst case (every center expands)

Space Complexity: O(1) (only counters and pointers used)
