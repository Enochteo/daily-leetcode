## Longest Palindromic Substring
**Understand**
You are given a string s.
Your task is to find the longest substring of s that is a palindrome.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters, and a palindrome reads the same forward and backward.

Example:
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab" or "aba"
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

**Match**
This is a Two-Pointer Expansion problem.
It uses the idea of expanding around centers to detect palindromes in both odd and even lengths.

**Plan**
Initialize two class-level variables:

palindrome_index: the starting index of the longest palindrome

substring_length: the length of the longest palindrome found so far

Loop through each character in the string:

Treat each character as the center of a potential odd-length palindrome.

Treat each character and the next as the center of a potential even-length palindrome.

Define a helper method palindromic_counter(s, l, r) that:

Expands outward while s[l] == s[r] and indices are valid

Updates palindrome_index and substring_length if a longer palindrome is found

After the loop, return the slice of s from palindrome_index to palindrome_index + substring_length.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
        self.palindrome_index = self.substring_length = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            self.palindromic_counter(s, i, i)       # odd-length center
            self.palindromic_counter(s, i, i + 1)   # even-length center
        return s[self.palindrome_index: self.palindrome_index + self.substring_length]

    def palindromic_counter(self, s, l, r):
        while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
            if r - l + 1 > self.substring_length:
                self.palindrome_index = l
                self.substring_length = r - l + 1
            r += 1
            l -= 1
```

**Review**
Checks both odd and even length palindromes

Expands around all possible centers

Efficiently updates the best result without unnecessary storage

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) due to center expansion at each index

Space Complexity: O(1) since only index tracking variables are used
