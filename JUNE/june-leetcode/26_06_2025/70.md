## Climbing Stairs Problem
**Understand**
You are climbing a staircase with n steps.
You can take either 1 step or 2 steps at a time.
Return the total number of distinct ways to reach the top.

Example:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The ways are (1+1+1), (1+2), and (2+1)

**Match**
This is a Dynamic Programming problem.
It follows the Fibonacci pattern because:

To get to step i, you must come from step i-1 or step i-2

So dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

**Plan**
Initialize a DP array of size n to store the number of ways to reach each step.

Handle base cases:

1 way to climb 1 step

2 ways to climb 2 steps

For each step i â‰¥ 2, compute dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

Return dp[-1], the total ways to reach step n

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        dp = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                dp[i] = 1
            elif i == 1:
                dp[i] = 2
            else:
                dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
        return dp[-1]
```

**Review**
Correctly implements the Fibonacci-style DP

Handles base cases for n = 1 and n = 2

Efficient for values of n within standard constraints

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n), one pass through n steps

Space Complexity: O(n), due to DP array
(Can be optimized to O(1) using two variables)
