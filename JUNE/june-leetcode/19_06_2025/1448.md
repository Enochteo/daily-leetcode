## Good Nodes in a Binary Tree
This project counts the number of "good" nodes in a binary tree. A node X is considered good if there are no nodes with a greater value than X on the path from the root to X. The problem is solved using depth-first search (DFS) and follows the UMPIRE framework.

**Understand**
You are given the root of a binary tree. A node is called good if the value on the path from the root to that node is always less than or equal to the nodeâ€™s value.

We need to count how many such nodes exist in the tree.

**Match**
This problem fits the pattern of:

Tree traversal (DFS)

Keeping track of state (maximum value) along the path

Simple recursive design


Plan
Initialize a counter to keep track of good nodes.

Use DFS to traverse the tree.

At each node, compare its value with the maximum value seen so far on the path from the root.

If the node's value is greater than or equal to the max, increment the counter.

Update the max for the child nodes as needed.

Return the final count after traversal.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def goodNodes(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = [0]
        def dfs(root, max_parent):
            if not root:
                return
            if root.val >= max_parent:
                count[0] += 1
                max_parent = root.val
            dfs(root.left, max_parent)
            dfs(root.right, max_parent)
        dfs(root, root.val)
        return count[0]
```

**Review**
The DFS visits each node and carries the maximum value seen so far on that path.

A list is used for count to allow mutation inside the nested function.

The solution is clean, readable, and handles all valid binary tree inputs.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes (every node is visited once).

Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).

Worst case: O(n) if the tree is skewed

Best case: O(log n) if the tree is balanced
