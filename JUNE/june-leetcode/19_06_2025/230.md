## Kth Smallest Element in a BST
This project solves the problem of finding the kth smallest element in a Binary Search Tree (BST) using in-order traversal and follows the UMPIRE problem-solving framework.

**Understand**
We are given the root of a Binary Search Tree and an integer k. We need to return the kth smallest value in the tree.
Because of the properties of BSTs, performing an in-order traversal will yield the elements in sorted (ascending) order.

**Match**
This problem matches well with:

Tree traversal problems

In-order traversal to get sorted values

Array index access to retrieve the kth value

Data Structure: Binary Search Tree
Pattern: Depth-First Search (In-order Traversal)

**Plan**
Initialize an empty list to store node values.

Define a recursive in-order DFS function:

Traverse the left subtree

Append the current nodeâ€™s value

Traverse the right subtree

Call the DFS on the root.

Return the element at index k - 1 in the result list.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def kthSmallest(self, root, k):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = []
        def dfs(root):
            if root:
                dfs(root.left)
                res.append(root.val)
                dfs(root.right)
        dfs(root)
        return res[k-1]
```

**Review**
The function uses in-order traversal to collect values in ascending order.

The kth smallest value is simply the k-1th index in this list.

Handles valid BST input and assumes k is within valid bounds.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n) in the worst case (unbalanced tree), where n is the number of nodes.

Space Complexity: O(n) due to storing all node values in a list.

Could be optimized to O(h + k) time and O(h) space with early stopping and a counter.
