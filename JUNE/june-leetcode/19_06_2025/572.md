## Subtree of Another Tree
This question is to determine whether one binary tree is a subtree of another. It uses a recursive depth-first search approach to compare structure and values between the main tree and the potential subtree.

**Understand**
We are given two binary trees: root and subRoot. We need to determine whether subRoot is a subtree of root.

A subtree is defined as a node in root such that the tree rooted at that node is structurally identical to subRoot.

**Match**
This problem matches:

Tree traversal (DFS)

Recursive comparison

Structural tree equality

We will use a recursive approach that:

Traverses every node in root.

At each node, checks if the subtree rooted at that node is identical to subRoot.

**Plan**
If either root or subRoot is None, return False.

Define a helper function checker() that returns True if two trees are identical in structure and value.

At each node in root, call checker(root, subRoot):

If it returns True, subRoot is a valid subtree.

Otherwise, recursively check root.left and root.right.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isSubtree(self, root, subRoot):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :type subRoot: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not root or not subRoot:
            return False

        def checker(root1, root2):
            if not root1 and not root2:
                return True
            if root1 and not root2:
                return False
            if root2 and not root1:
                return False
            if root1.val != root2.val:
                return False
            return checker(root1.left, root2.left) and checker(root1.right, root2.right)
        
        if checker(root, subRoot):
            return True
        
        return self.isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) or self.isSubtree(root.right, subRoot)
```
**Review**
The function checker() accurately compares two trees for structural and value equality.

The recursive call ensures every node in the main tree is considered as a potential subtree root.

Handles all cases, including:

Unbalanced trees

Identical trees

Deep subtrees


**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of nodes in root and n is the number of nodes in subRoot (in the worst case, compare subRoot with every node of root).

Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree due to recursion stack.
