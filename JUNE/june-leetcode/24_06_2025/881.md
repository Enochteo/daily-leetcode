## Boats to Save People
The problem is to solve determining the minimum number of rescue boats needed to save people with given weights, where each boat can carry at most two people without exceeding the weight limit.


**Understand**
Given a list people representing weights, and an integer limit representing the maximum capacity of a boat, you must return the minimum number of boats needed to rescue everyone.

Each boat can carry at most two people at a time.

The combined weight of people on a boat must not exceed limit.

**Match**
This is a classic two-pointer greedy problem:

Sort the input

Use two pointers to attempt pairing the lightest and heaviest

Optimize for maximum space usage in each boat


**Plan**
Sort the people by weight in ascending order.

Initialize two pointers:

l at the start (lightest)

r at the end (heaviest)

While l <= r:

Always use one boat for the heaviest person (people[r])

Try to pair them with the lightest (people[l]) if the combined weight fits within the limit

Increment boat count for each attempt


**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def numRescueBoats(self, people, limit):
        """
        :type people: List[int]
        :type limit: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        boats = 0
        people.sort()
        l, r = 0, len(people) - 1

        while l <= r:
            remainder = limit - people[r]
            r -= 1
            boats += 1
            if l <= r and remainder >= people[l]:
                l += 1
        return boats
```

**Review**
Efficient greedy two-pointer strategy

Avoids unnecessary pairing attempts

Handles edge case of a single person remaining

In-place and O(n log n) due to sorting

Time Complexity	O(n log n)
Space Complexity	O(1)
