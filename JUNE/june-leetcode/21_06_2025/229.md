## Majority Element II
This project finds all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times in a given array. It uses an optimized extension of the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, designed to work in O(n) time and O(1) space.

**Understand**
You're given an integer array nums. Find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

 It’s guaranteed that there can be at most two such elements, since:

If an element appears > n/3 times,

At most 2 such distinct elements can exist in the array of size n.

**Match**
This is a classic:

Voting algorithm

Counting pattern

Similar to the "Majority Element I" problem (where count > n/2)

**Plan**
Initialize two candidate variables (majority1, majority2) and their counters.

First Pass: Identify potential candidates using the Boyer-Moore majority voting method:

If count is 0, assign the candidate

If the number matches a candidate, increment its count

Otherwise, decrement both counts

Second Pass: Recount actual occurrences of the two candidates

Return the candidates that occur more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        majority1 = majority2 = count1 = count2 = 0

        # Step 1: Find potential candidates
        for num in nums:
            if num == majority1:
                count1 += 1
            elif num == majority2:
                count2 += 1
            elif count1 == 0:
                majority1 = num
                count1 = 1
            elif count2 == 0:
                majority2 = num
                count2 = 1
            else:
                count1 -= 1
                count2 -= 1

        # Step 2: Verify candidates
        count1 = count2 = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num == majority1:
                count1 += 1
            elif num == majority2:
                count2 += 1

        # Step 3: Append results if counts > n/3
        res = []
        if count1 > len(nums) // 3:
            res.append(majority1)
        if count2 > len(nums) // 3:
            res.append(majority2)

        return res
```

**Review**
This solution runs in linear time with two passes over the array.

It avoids sorting or hash maps, achieving O(1) extra space.

Handles edge cases (e.g. empty list, single element) cleanly.
