## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
This project solves the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" problem by finding the maximum profit from a single buy-sell transaction in an array of stock prices. It demonstrates a progression from a brute-force approach to an optimized linear-time solution using tracking variables.

**Understand**
You're given a list prices where prices[i] represents the stock price on day i.

You must return the maximum profit you can achieve by:

Buying once

Selling once later

Return 0 if no profit is possible.

**Match**
This is a classic:

Single-pass optimization

Array traversal with state tracking

"Buy low, sell high" pattern

Similar to sliding window and greedy problems.

**Plan**
Start by assuming the minimum price is infinity.

Iterate through the array:

If the current price is less than min_price, update min_price

Otherwise, calculate current_profit = price - min_price and update max_profit

Return max_profit

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        max_profit = 0
        min_price = float('inf')
        
        for price in prices:
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            else:
                max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
        
        return max_profit
```

**Review**
This solution performs a single pass through the list (O(n))

Tracks the best buy opportunity using min_price

Always computes profit only if a valid selling day follows the buying day
