## Isomorphic Strings - Easy
Understand:
The problem was to check if two strings are isomorphic. Two strings would be isomorphic if you could replace the strings in one with a corresponding one at the same index and the string would be the same as the second.

Match:
The problem would involve the use of Hash tables.

Plan:
- We would create hash tables for both strings
- We would store the index of the first occurence of each character in the hash table.
- If we encounter two characters in the strings that have the same index in the string but their values in their respective hash tables are not the same. We then return False

Implement
- Initialize both hash tables (dictionaries)
- iterate over any string (they have to be the same length)
- If a character in any of the strings of both are not in their hash tables -> store the 
index in the has table with the key as the character
- Now we check if the value of the hash table with the key of s's character is not the same as that of t's character (they dont have the same first index) we return False
- else we return True

Evaluate:
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
