## Counting Bits 
Understand:
The problem is to count the number of bits in each number as we would count from xero to that number inclusive and add it to a list. e.g 4 -> 0,1,2,3,4 -> 0, 1, 10, 11, 100 -> [0,1,1,2,1], etc

Match:
The problem would involve bit manipulation -> Bit shifting and bit masking

Plan:
- loop
