## Flatten Binary Tree Linked List
**Undeerstand**
Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list". This should be done in such a way that:
- all nodes should be connected only via the right pointers
- all nodes connection maintain the preorder traversal of the original tree
i.e

```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \    \
3   4    6
``` becomes
```
    1
     \
      2
       \
        3
         \
          4
           \
            5
             \
              6
```
