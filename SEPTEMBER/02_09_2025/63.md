## Unique Paths II

**Understand**
Given a grid obstacleGrid where 1 denotes an obstacle and 0 an empty cell, count the number of unique paths from top-left (0,0) to bottom-right (m-1,n-1) moving only down or right. If the start or end is blocked, the answer is 0.

**Match**
Two standard approaches, both in your code:

Bottom-up DP with an extra padded row/column to avoid bounds checks; accumulate paths from destination backwards, skipping obstacle cells.

Top-down DFS with memoization (lru_cache), returning 0 when out of bounds or on an obstacle, and 1 at the destination.
