## Unique Paths
**Understand**
We are given a grid of size m x n. A robot starts at the top-left (0,0) and can only move down or right. Find the total number of unique paths to reach the bottom-right (m-1,n-1).

**Match**
Recursive DFS with memoization:

From (row, col), the number of paths = paths from (row+1, col) (down) + (row, col+1) (right).

Base cases:

If at bottom-right cell → 1 path.

If out of bounds → 0 paths.

Use lru_cache to memoize states and avoid recomputation.
