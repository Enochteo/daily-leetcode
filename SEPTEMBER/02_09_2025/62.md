## Unique Paths - Optimized
**Understand**
We need the number of unique paths in an m x n grid from top-left (0,0) to bottom-right (m-1,n-1) moving only down or right.

**Match**
Dynamic Programming (tabulation):

Each cell (r,c) stores the number of paths from (r,c) to the goal.

Transition: dp[r][c] = dp[r+1][c] + dp[r][c+1].

Base case: dp[m-1][n-1] = 1.

Fill table from bottom-right corner back to (0,0).
