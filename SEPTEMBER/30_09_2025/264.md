## Ugly Number II

**Understand**
Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.

Definition of an ugly number:
A positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Example:

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

**Match**

- The problem could be solved using three pointers for multiples of 2,3,5, using an hashset to prevent checking the number more than once.

**Plan**

- create an empty array with an initial value of 1, ugly 0 is 1
- initialize threee pointers at 0
- loop till the array has a length of n
- for the next candidate, pick the smallest multiple from the current states of each pointer
- conditionally move pointers while preventing duplicates.
- append to the array if it is not in the set

**Implement**

```py
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        ugly = [1]
        p1, p2, p3 = 0, 0, 0
        while len(ugly) != n:
            cand1 = ugly[p1]*2
            cand2 = ugly[p2]*3
            cand3 = ugly[p3]*5

            next_num = min(cand1, cand2, cand3)
            if next_num == cand1:
                p1 += 1
            if next_num == cand2:
                p2 += 1
            if next_num == cand3:
                p3 += 1
            ugly.append(next_num)
        return ugly[-1]
```

**Review**

- The while loop ensures the list is of the length.
- so returning the last index gives you the nth ugly number.
- The separate if statements allow that duplicates be caught by incrementing all pointers involved.

**Evaluate**

- Time Complexity: ~ O(N)
