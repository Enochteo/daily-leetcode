## Ugly Number II

**Understand**
Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.

Definition of an ugly number:
A positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Example:

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

**Match**

- The problem could be solved using three pointers for multiples of 2,3,5, using an hashset to prevent checking the number more than once.
