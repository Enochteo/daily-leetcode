## Sort List

Understand

We are given the head of a singly linked list.

We must return the head of the list sorted in ascending order.

The solution must run in O(n log n) time.

It should use constant space (apart from recursion stack).

```
Example:

Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Match**

This is a linked list sorting problem.

Arrays can use quicksort/mergesort with indices, but linked lists are slow for random access.

Merge sort is best:

Splitting list with fast/slow pointers.

Merging two sorted linked lists.

Merge sort works in O(n log n) with O(1) extra space.
