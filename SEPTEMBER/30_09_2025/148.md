## Sort List

Understand

We are given the head of a singly linked list.

We must return the head of the list sorted in ascending order.

The solution must run in O(n log n) time.

It should use constant space (apart from recursion stack).

```
Example:

Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```
