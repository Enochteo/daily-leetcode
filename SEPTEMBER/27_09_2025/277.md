## Find the Celebrity
**Understand**

We are at a party with n people labeled 0..n-1.

A celebrity is defined as:

Everyone knows them.

They know no one else.

We have access to an API knows(a, b) which returns True if person a knows person b.

We must return the celebrityâ€™s label, or -1 if none exists.

Example:

Input: n = 3, relations = knows matrix
Output: 1
Explanation: Person 1 is known by everyone and knows nobody

**Match**

This is a graph problem but solved with a two-pass elimination approach:

If a knows b, then a cannot be the celebrity.

If a does not know b, then b cannot be the celebrity.

After one pass, only one candidate remains.

Validate candidate in second pass.
