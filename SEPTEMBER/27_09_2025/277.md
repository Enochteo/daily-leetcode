## Find the Celebrity
**Understand**

We are at a party with n people labeled 0..n-1.

A celebrity is defined as:

Everyone knows them.

They know no one else.

We have access to an API knows(a, b) which returns True if person a knows person b.

We must return the celebrity’s label, or -1 if none exists.

Example:

Input: n = 3, relations = knows matrix
Output: 1
Explanation: Person 1 is known by everyone and knows nobody

**Match**

This is a graph problem but solved with a two-pass elimination approach:

If a knows b, then a cannot be the celebrity.

If a does not know b, then b cannot be the celebrity.

After one pass, only one candidate remains.

Validate candidate in second pass.

**Plan**

Initialize candidate = 0.

Loop through 1..n-1:

If candidate knows i, then candidate cannot be celebrity → update candidate = i.

After loop, validate candidate:

Check that candidate knows nobody.

Check that everyone else knows candidate.

If checks pass → return candidate.

Otherwise → return -1.

**Implement**
```py
"""
The knows API is already defined for you.
@param a, person a
@param b, person b
@return a boolean, whether a knows b
you can call Celebrity.knows(a, b)
"""

class Solution:
    # @param {int} n a party with n people
    # @return {int} the celebrity's label or -1
    def findCelebrity(self, n):
        candidate = 0
        # First pass: find candidate
        for i in range(1, n):
            if Celebrity.knows(candidate, i):
                candidate = i
        
        # Second pass: validate candidate
        for i in range(n):
            if i == candidate:
                continue
            if Celebrity.knows(candidate, i) or not Celebrity.knows(i, candidate):
                return -1
        return candidate
```
**Review**

First loop eliminates non-candidates in O(n).

Second loop validates candidate with 2n API calls.

Efficient compared to naive O(n²) pairwise checking.

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: O(n), since each of the two passes takes linear time.

Space Complexity: O(1), only constant extra space used.

**Pattern to remember**

For celebrity finding with knows() API:

Use elimination in one pass to narrow to a single candidate.

Validate in second pass by ensuring:

Candidate knows no one.

Everyone else knows candidate.
