## Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
**Understand**

We are given the root of a binary tree.

We must return the level order traversal of its nodesâ€™ values, but with a twist:

First level is left-to-right.

Second level is right-to-left.

Alternate for every level.

**Example**:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]


Constraints:

0 <= number of nodes <= 2000

Node values are integers.

**Match**

This is a binary tree traversal problem.

BFS naturally gives levels.

At each level, decide whether to reverse the order.

Toggle reversal flag after each level.
