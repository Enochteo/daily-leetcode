## Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
**Understand**

We are given the head of a sorted linked list. We must delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers in the list.

**Example**:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```
```
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```
