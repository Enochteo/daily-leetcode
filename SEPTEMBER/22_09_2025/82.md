## Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
**Understand**

We are given the head of a sorted linked list. We must delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers in the list.

**Example**:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```
```
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Match**

This is a linked list traversal problem.

Because the list is sorted, duplicates appear in contiguous groups.

We need to skip entire groups of duplicates.

Use a dummy node before the head to simplify handling of deletions at the beginning.

**Plan**

Create a dummy node pointing to head.

Use prev pointer (last confirmed distinct node) and cur pointer (iterator).

Traverse the list:

If cur has duplicates (cur.val == cur.next.val), advance cur until the end of the duplicate group.

Then connect prev.next to cur.next (skip duplicates).

Otherwise, move prev forward.

Continue until the end of the list.

Return dummy.next.

**Implement**
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(101, head)
        prev, cur = dummy, head
        
        while cur:
            if cur.next and cur.val == cur.next.val:
                while cur.next and cur.val == cur.next.val:
                    cur = cur.next
                prev.next = cur.next
            else:
                prev = prev.next
            cur = cur.next
        
        return dummy.next
```

**Review**

dummy simplifies edge cases where head itself is duplicated.

prev ensures we reconnect the list correctly when duplicates are skipped.

Traversal continues until cur becomes None.

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: O(n), each node visited at most twice.

Space Complexity: O(1), iterative with constant pointers.
