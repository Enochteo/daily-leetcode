## Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
**Understand**

We are given the head of a sorted linked list. We must delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers in the list.

**Example**:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```
```
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Match**

This is a linked list traversal problem.

Because the list is sorted, duplicates appear in contiguous groups.

We need to skip entire groups of duplicates.

Use a dummy node before the head to simplify handling of deletions at the beginning.

**Plan**

Create a dummy node pointing to head.

Use prev pointer (last confirmed distinct node) and cur pointer (iterator).

Traverse the list:

If cur has duplicates (cur.val == cur.next.val), advance cur until the end of the duplicate group.

Then connect prev.next to cur.next (skip duplicates).

Otherwise, move prev forward.

Continue until the end of the list.

Return dummy.next.
