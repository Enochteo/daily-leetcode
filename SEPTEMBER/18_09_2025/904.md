## Fruit Into Baskets
**Understand**

We are given an array fruits where each element represents a type of fruit on a tree. We have two baskets, and each basket can only hold one type of fruit. We want the length of the longest contiguous subarray that contains at most two distinct fruit types.

**Example**:
```
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Take all 3 trees â†’ types {1,2}.

```
**Constraints**:

1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5

0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length

**Match**

This is a sliding window problem with at most 2 distinct values.

Maintain a window with two fruit types.

Expand window by moving right pointer.

Shrink from the left when window exceeds 2 fruit types.

**Plan**

Initialize l = 0, max_len = 0, and window_counter as a hashmap to count fruits in window.

Iterate r over fruits:

Add fruits[r] to window_counter.

While more than 2 distinct fruits:

Decrement count of fruits[l].

If count becomes 0, remove from map.

Increment l to shrink window.

Update max_len = max(max_len, r - l + 1).

Return max_len.
