## Fruit Into Baskets
**Understand**

We are given an array fruits where each element represents a type of fruit on a tree. We have two baskets, and each basket can only hold one type of fruit. We want the length of the longest contiguous subarray that contains at most two distinct fruit types.

**Example**:
```
Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Take all 3 trees â†’ types {1,2}.

```
**Constraints**:

1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5

0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length
