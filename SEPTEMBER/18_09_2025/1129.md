## Shortest Path with Alternating Colors
**Understand**

We are given a directed graph with n nodes labeled 0..n-1. Edges are either red or blue.

We want the shortest distance from node 0 to every node such that the path alternates edge colors.

If no such path exists, return -1 for that node.

**Match**

This is a BFS shortest path problem with stateful traversal.

State includes (node, last_color) to enforce alternating edges.

BFS ensures shortest path discovery.

Use a visited set to avoid revisiting (node, color) states.

**Plan**

Build adjacency list adj[node] = [(nei, color)].

Initialize queue with (0, None) since we can start with any edge color.

Maintain dist array initialized to -1.

BFS with steps counter:

For each node at current level:

If dist[node] == -1, set it to steps.

For each (nei, color) in adjacency list:

If color != last_color and (nei, color) not visited â†’ enqueue.

Increment steps after each BFS layer.

Return dist.
