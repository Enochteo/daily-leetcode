## Number of Islands
Understand

We are given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water). An island is a group of connected '1's connected vertically or horizontally (not diagonally).

The task is to return the number of distinct islands.

**Example**:
```
Input: 
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","0","1"],
  ["0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```
