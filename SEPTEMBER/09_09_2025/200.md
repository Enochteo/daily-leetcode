## Number of Islands
Understand

We are given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water). An island is a group of connected '1's connected vertically or horizontally (not diagonally).

The task is to return the number of distinct islands.

**Example**:
```
Input: 
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","0","1"],
  ["0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Match**

This is a graph traversal problem.

Model the grid as a graph where each land cell is a node.

Perform DFS/BFS from each unvisited land cell to mark the entire island.

Count how many DFS/BFS calls are needed.

**Plan**

Initialize islands = 0 and visited set.

Define dfs(r, c):

Base case: return if out of bounds, water, or already visited.

Otherwise, mark (r, c) visited.

Recurse in four directions.

Iterate over all cells (r, c) in the grid:

If the cell is '1' and not visited, increment islands and call dfs(r, c).

Return islands.
