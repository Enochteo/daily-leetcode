## Generate Parentheses
**Understand**

We need to generate all valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses.

Example:

n = 3 → ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"].

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 8.

**Match**

This is a backtracking problem:

Keep track of how many ( and ) have been used.

Only add ( if we haven’t used all n.

Only add ) if it won’t make the string invalid (i.e., if opens > closes).

**Plan**

Initialize res as the answer list.

Define recursive function generate(path, opens, closes):

If len(path) == 2*n, append to result.

If opens < n, add ( and recurse.

If closes < n and opens > closes, add ) and recurse.

Start recursion with path="(", opens=1, closes=0.

Return res.
