## Missing Number
**Understand**

We are given an array nums containing n distinct numbers taken from the range [0, n].
We must return the one number in the range that is missing from nums.

**Match**

This is a math + array problem.

The sum of the range [0..n] is n*(n+1)/2.

The missing number = expected sum â€“ actual sum.

**Plan**

Compute n = len(nums).

Compute expected = n*(n+1)//2.

Compute actual = sum(nums).

Return expected - actual.
