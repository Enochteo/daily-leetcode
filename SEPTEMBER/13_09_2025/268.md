## Missing Number
**Understand**

We are given an array nums containing n distinct numbers taken from the range [0, n].
We must return the one number in the range that is missing from nums.

**Match**

This is a math + array problem.

The sum of the range [0..n] is n*(n+1)/2.

The missing number = expected sum â€“ actual sum.

**Plan**

Compute n = len(nums).

Compute expected = n*(n+1)//2.

Compute actual = sum(nums).

Return expected - actual.

**Implement**
```py
class Solution(object):
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        return ((len(nums)) * (len(nums) + 1)) // 2 - sum(nums)
```

**Review**

Uses formula for arithmetic series sum.

Constant time arithmetic and single pass sum.

Elegant one-line solution.

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: O(n), for computing sum of nums.

Space Complexity: O(1).

**Pattern to remember**

For finding a missing element in 0..n:

Use expected_sum = n*(n+1)/2.

Answer = expected_sum - actual_sum.
