## Unique Binary Search Trees II

**Understand**
Weâ€™re asked to generate all structurally unique BSTs that store values 1..n.

Each BST must follow the BST property: left < root < right.

Different structures count as different BSTs, even if they contain the same values.

**Match**
Recursive tree construction:

Pick each number val in [left..right] as root.

Recursively generate all possible left subtrees from [left..val-1].

Recursively generate all possible right subtrees from [val+1..right].

Combine each left and right subtree with the root.

Base cases:

If left > right: return [None].

If left == right: return [TreeNode(left)].
