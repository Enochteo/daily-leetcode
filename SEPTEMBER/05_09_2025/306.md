## Additive Number
**Understand**
An additive number is a string whose digits can form a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two, with at least three numbers in total. Leading zeros are not allowed unless the number itself is zero. Return True if num is additive.

Key rules:

Choose the first two numbers; the rest must be uniquely determined.

No leading zeros for multi-digit numbers.
