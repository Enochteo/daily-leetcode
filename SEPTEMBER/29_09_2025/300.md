## Longest Increasing Subsequence

**Understand**

We are given an array nums and must find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence (LIS).

A subsequence is formed by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order.

Increasing means each subsequent element is greater than the previous one.

```
Example:

Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: LIS = [2,3,7,101]
```

**Constraints**:

1 <= nums.length <= 2500

-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

**Match**

This is a dynamic programming problem.

For each index i, LIS length starting at i depends on valid choices j > i with nums[j] > nums[i].

**Recurrence**:

dp[i] = 1 + max(dp[j]) for j > i and nums[j] > nums[i]

Otherwise, dp[i] = 1 (itself only).

**Plan**

Initialize dp[i] = 1 for all i.

Iterate i from right to left.

For each i, iterate j from i+1..n-1:

If nums[j] > nums[i], update dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[j]).

Answer is max(dp).
