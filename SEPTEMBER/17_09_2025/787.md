## Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
**Understand**

We are given n cities labeled 0..n-1, a list of flights flights[i] = [from, to, price], a source city src, a destination city dst, and an integer k.

We need to return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If no route exists, return -1.

**Match**

This is a shortest path problem with a stop constraint.

Standard Dijkstra finds shortest path, but here we also need to track the number of stops.

Use a priority queue (cost, node, stops) to always expand the cheapest path first.

Use a DP table dist[node][stops] to record the cheapest cost to reach node with stops stops.
