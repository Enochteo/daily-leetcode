## Course Schedule
**Understand**

We are given numCourses and a list of prerequisite pairs [a, b] meaning you must complete course b before course a.

We need to determine if it’s possible to finish all courses (i.e., no circular dependencies).

**Match**

This is a cycle detection in a directed graph problem.

Graph = courses as nodes, prerequisites as directed edges.

If graph has a cycle → cannot finish.

Solution: DFS with recursion stack (track path).

**Plan**

Build adjacency list: adj[course] = [list of prerequisites].

Maintain two sets:

visit = courses fully processed (safe).

path = current recursion stack (detect cycles).

Define DFS:

If node in path → cycle → return False.

If node in visit → already processed → return True.

Add node to path.

Recurse on neighbors. If any returns False → fail.

Remove node from path, add to visit.

Return True.

For each course not in visit, run DFS.

If all pass, return True.
