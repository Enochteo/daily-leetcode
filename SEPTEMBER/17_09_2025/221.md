## Maximal Square
**Understand**

We are given a binary matrix filled with '0's and '1's. We need to find the area of the largest square containing only '1'.

**Match**

This is a dynamic programming (DP) problem.

At each cell (r, c), if itâ€™s '1', then the size of the maximal square ending at (r, c) depends on:

Below (r+1, c)

Right (r, c+1)

Diagonal (r+1, c+1)

**Formula**:
```
dp[r][c] = 1 + min(dp[r+1][c], dp[r][c+1], dp[r+1][c+1])
```
