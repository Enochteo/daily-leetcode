## Binary Search Tree Iterator
**Understand**
We are asked to implement a binary tree iterator that iterates over a BST in sorted order (inorder) `left->cur->right`.
It should have three methods:
- `__init__` - to initialize the class
- `next` - to move the current pointer to the next element in the inorder sequence (next greater element) and then return the node. (N.B It would always have a next)
- `hasNext` - which returns a boolean as to whether or not there exists a node next to the current node in the iterator.
