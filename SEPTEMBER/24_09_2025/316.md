## Remove Duplicate Letters
**Understand**
We are given a string and asked to remove all duplicates in the string (make the resulting string contain the unique letters in the string). There are various formats this could be gotten but the catch is that it must be returned in the smallest lexicographically of all possible results.

**Example**
```
s = "cbacdcbd"
ans = "cbac", "bacd", "acdb", "adcb", ... are all possible results
but the required result is 
ans = "acdb"
```
