## Restore IP Addresses
**Understand**
Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting three dots into s.
Validity rules for each of the 4 segments:

Value in [0, 255].

No leading zeros unless the segment is exactly "0" (e.g., "0", "10" valid; "00", "01" invalid).

**Match**
Backtracking: build segments left-to-right, trying segment lengths 1â€“3, pruning when a segment would be >255 or would start with '0' and have length >1. Track how many segments (dots) have been placed and the current index.
