## Restore IP Addresses
**Understand**
Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting three dots into s.
Validity rules for each of the 4 segments:

Value in [0, 255].

No leading zeros unless the segment is exactly "0" (e.g., "0", "10" valid; "00", "01" invalid).

**Match**
Backtracking: build segments left-to-right, trying segment lengths 1–3, pruning when a segment would be >255 or would start with '0' and have length >1. Track how many segments (dots) have been placed and the current index.

**Plan**

Recurse with parameters (index, dots, ip_string).

If dots == 4 and index == len(s), we have a valid IP; append it (trim trailing dot).

If dots > 4, backtrack.

Try segment ends i from index to min(index+2, len(s)-1):

Convert s[index:i+1] to int and ensure ≤ 255.

Leading-zero rule: allow '0' only if the segment length is 1.

If valid, recurse from i+1 with dots+1.
