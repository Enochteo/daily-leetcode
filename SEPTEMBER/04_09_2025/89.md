## Gray Code
**Understand**
The problem asks us to generate a Gray code sequence of n bits.

Gray code is a sequence where successive numbers differ by exactly one bit.

For n=2, a valid sequence is [00, 01, 11, 10].

**Match**
Recursive reflection construction:

Base: `n=0 → ["0"], n=1 → ["0","1"].`

For n > 1:

Take (n-1)-bit Gray code.

Prepend '0' to the original sequence.

Prepend '1' to the reversed sequence.

Combine to form the n-bit Gray code.

Finally, convert binary strings to integers.
