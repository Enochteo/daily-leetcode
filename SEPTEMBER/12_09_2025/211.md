## Design Add and Search Words Data Structure
**Understand**

We need to design a data structure that supports two operations:

addWord(word) – add a word to the structure.

search(word) – return true if the word exists, with the ability to use . as a wildcard that matches any single character

**Match**

This is a trie (prefix tree) problem with support for wildcard search.

Trie efficiently stores words character by character.

For search:

If normal character: follow child node.

If .: recursively check all children.

**Plan**

Implement a TrieNode with:

children: dict for next letters.

isEnd: boolean for word ending.

addWord(word):

Traverse trie, inserting nodes if missing.

Mark end node as word end.

search(word):

Define recursive helper backtrack(index, node).

If index == len(word): return node.isEnd.

If word[index] == '.': try all children recursively.

Else: follow the matching child if it exists.

Return whether a valid path exists.
