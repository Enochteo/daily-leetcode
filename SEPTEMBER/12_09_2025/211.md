## Design Add and Search Words Data Structure
**Understand**

We need to design a data structure that supports two operations:

addWord(word) – add a word to the structure.

search(word) – return true if the word exists, with the ability to use . as a wildcard that matches any single character

**Match**

This is a trie (prefix tree) problem with support for wildcard search.

Trie efficiently stores words character by character.

For search:

If normal character: follow child node.

If .: recursively check all children.
