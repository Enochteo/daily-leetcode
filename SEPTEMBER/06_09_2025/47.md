## Permutations II
**Understand**
We’re asked to generate all unique permutations of nums, which may contain duplicates.

If we naïvely permute and store results in a set, it’s inefficient. Instead, we avoid duplicates directly during recursion by keeping track of how many of each number remain.

**Match**
Backtracking with frequency map (Counter):

At each step, choose a number that still has a positive count.

Append it to the current permutation, decrement its count, recurse.

Backtrack: pop and restore the count.

Stop when the permutation length equals len(nums).
