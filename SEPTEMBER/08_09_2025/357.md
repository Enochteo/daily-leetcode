## Count Numbers with Unique Digits
**Understand**

We want to count how many numbers in the range `[0, 10^n)` have all unique digits.

**Example**:

`n = 2` â†’ numbers `[0..99].` Valid examples: `0, 1, 2, ..., 10, 12, 34`. Invalid examples: `11, 22`.

Answer for n = 2 is 91.

**Constraints**:

0 <= n <= 8.

**Match**

This is a backtracking / combinatorial counting problem.

We try to build numbers digit by digit.

Track which digits have been used with a set.

Skip repeats, prune when we reach 10^n.

Alternative approach (faster): use combinatorial counting formula:

For length k, the count is 9 * 9 * 8 * ... (permutations of digits).
