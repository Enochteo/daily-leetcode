## Count Numbers with Unique Digits
**Understand**

Count how many numbers with unique digits exist in the range `[0, 10^n)`.

For n = 2 (numbers 0–99), the answer is 91.

For n = 0, only number is 0, so return 1.

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 8.

**Match**

This is a combinatorics problem.

For 1-digit numbers: 10 choices (0–9).

For 2-digit numbers: 9 * 9 choices (first digit 1–9, second digit 0–9 excluding first).

For 3-digit numbers: 9 * 9 * 8.

General: 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 … as digits decrease.

We accumulate counts across all lengths from 1 to n.
