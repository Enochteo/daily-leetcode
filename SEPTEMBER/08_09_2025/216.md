## Combination Sum III
**Understand**

We are asked to find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to n, using numbers from 1–9.

Each number can be used at most once.

The combinations should be unique.

Order doesn’t matter ([1,2,3] is the same as [3,2,1]).

**Example**:

Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]


Only one valid combination: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Constraints:

2 <= k <= 9

1 <= n <= 60

**Match**

This is a backtracking / DFS problem.
We explore candidates (1–9), track the running sum and path, and prune early if:

The sum exceeds n.

The path length exceeds k.

Key idea: controlled recursion with pruning.

**Plan**

Maintain a path list for the current combination.

Start recursion from index=1 to 9.

At each step:

If sum(path) > n: stop (prune).

If len(path) == k:

Check if sum(path) == n, then save a copy.

Otherwise, iterate from index to 9, append the candidate, recurse, and backtrack.

Return all stored results.
