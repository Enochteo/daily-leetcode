## Combination Sum III
**Understand**

We are asked to find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to n, using numbers from 1–9.

Each number can be used at most once.

The combinations should be unique.

Order doesn’t matter ([1,2,3] is the same as [3,2,1]).

**Example**:

Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]


Only one valid combination: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Constraints:

2 <= k <= 9

1 <= n <= 60
