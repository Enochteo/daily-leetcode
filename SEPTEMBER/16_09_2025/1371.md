## Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts

**Understand**

We are given a string s. We want the length of the longest substring such that each of the five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) appears an even number of times.

```
Example:

Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
Output: 13
Explanation: "leetminicowor" has even counts of all vowels.
```

**Match**

This is a prefix + bitmask problem.

Track the parity (even/odd) of each vowel using a 5-bit mask.

At each index, update the mask when encountering a vowel.

If the same mask has been seen before, the substring between indices has all vowels even (since parity cancels out).

Store earliest index of each mask in a hashmap to maximize substring length.

**Plan**

Map each vowel to a bit position.

Initialize mask = 0 (all vowels even initially).

Use dictionary last_index_of_mask = {0: -1} to record first occurrence of each mask.

Iterate through string with index i:

If char is a vowel, flip its bit in mask.

If mask seen before, compute length = i - last_index_of_mask[mask].

Otherwise, store last_index_of_mask[mask] = i.

Track maximum length found.

Return result.

**Implement**
```py
class Solution:
    def findTheLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        vowels = 'aeiou'
        res = 0
        mask = 0
        last_index_of_mask = {0: -1}

        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in vowels:
                mask = mask ^ (1 << (ord(c) - ord('a')))
            if mask in last_index_of_mask:
                length = i - last_index_of_mask[mask]
                res = max(res, length)
            else:
                last_index_of_mask[mask] = i
        return res
```
