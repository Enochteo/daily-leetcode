## Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts

**Understand**

We are given a string s. We want the length of the longest substring such that each of the five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) appears an even number of times.

```
Example:

Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
Output: 13
Explanation: "leetminicowor" has even counts of all vowels.
