## Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts

**Understand**

We are given a string s. We want the length of the longest substring such that each of the five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) appears an even number of times.

```
Example:

Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
Output: 13
Explanation: "leetminicowor" has even counts of all vowels.
```

**Match**

This is a prefix + bitmask problem.

Track the parity (even/odd) of each vowel using a 5-bit mask.

At each index, update the mask when encountering a vowel.

If the same mask has been seen before, the substring between indices has all vowels even (since parity cancels out).

Store earliest index of each mask in a hashmap to maximize substring length.
