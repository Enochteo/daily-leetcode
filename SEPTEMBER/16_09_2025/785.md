## Is Graph Bipartite?
**Understand**

We are given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list, where graph[i] is the list of neighbors of node i.

A graph is bipartite if we can split its nodes into two groups such that no two adjacent nodes are in the same group.

**Match**

This is a graph traversal + coloring problem.

Assign colors (0 or 1) to nodes.

For each unvisited node, BFS/DFS and assign alternating colors.

If any neighbor has the same color as current, return False.

**Plan**

Initialize color array with -1 (uncolored).

For each node i:

If not colored, assign 0 and start BFS.

While BFS queue not empty:

Pop node, check all neighbors.

If neighbor uncolored, assign opposite color and push to queue.

If neighbor has same color as current, return False.

If no conflicts found, return True.

**Implement**
```py
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def isBipartite(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        n = len(graph)
        color = [-1] * n  

        for i in range(n):
            if color[i] == -1:  
                color[i] = 0
                q = deque([i])

                while q:
                    cur = q.popleft()
                    for nei in graph[cur]:
                        if color[nei] == -1:  
                            color[nei] = 1 - color[cur]
                            q.append(nei)
                        elif color[nei] == color[cur]:  
                            return False
        return True
```

**Review**

BFS guarantees level-order coloring.

Works for disconnected graphs by checking each component.

Returns False immediately on a coloring conflict.
