## Is Graph Bipartite?
**Understand**

We are given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list, where graph[i] is the list of neighbors of node i.

A graph is bipartite if we can split its nodes into two groups such that no two adjacent nodes are in the same group.

**Match**

This is a graph traversal + coloring problem.

Assign colors (0 or 1) to nodes.

For each unvisited node, BFS/DFS and assign alternating colors.

If any neighbor has the same color as current, return False.
