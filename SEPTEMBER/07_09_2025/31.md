## Next Permutation
**Understand**
Given an array nums, rearrange it into the next lexicographically greater permutation. If such arrangement isnâ€™t possible (array is in descending order), rearrange it to the lowest possible order (sorted ascending). Operation must be in-place.

**Match**
Greedy + suffix manipulation:

Scan from right to find the first pivot where nums[i] > nums[i-1].

If no pivot, reverse entire array (it was the last permutation).

Otherwise, find the rightmost successor greater than the pivot in the suffix, swap, then reverse the suffix to get the minimal larger ordering.

**Plan**

Find pivot index p = i-1 from right where nums[i] > nums[i-1].

If pivot not found, reverse whole array and return.

From the end, find first swap index with nums[swap] > nums[pivot].

Swap nums[pivot] and nums[swap].

Reverse the suffix starting at pivot+1.
