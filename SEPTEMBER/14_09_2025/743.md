## Network Delay Time
**Understand**

We are given a directed weighted graph with n nodes (labeled 1..n) and a list times where each element is [u, v, w] meaning there is a signal edge from node u to node v taking w time.

We start at node k and need to calculate how long it takes for all nodes to receive the signal.

If all nodes can be reached, return the maximum time among shortest paths from k.

If some nodes can’t be reached, return -1.

**Match**

This is a shortest path problem in a weighted directed graph.

Best-fit algorithm: Dijkstra’s algorithm (since weights are non-negative).

We use a min-heap priority queue to always expand the shortest distance node next.
