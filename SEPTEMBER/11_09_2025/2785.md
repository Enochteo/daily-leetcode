## Sort Vowels in a String
**Understand**

We are given a string s. The task is to sort only the vowels (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U) while leaving consonants and other characters in place.

**`Example`**:

Input:  `s = "lEetcOde"`
Output: `"lEOtcede"`


The vowels are E, e, O, e. Sorted order is E, O, e, e. After substitution, result = "lEOtcede".

**Constraints**:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5.

s contains only printable ASCII characters.

**Match**

This is a string reconstruction problem.

Strategy: count vowel frequencies, then rebuild string by consuming from sorted vowel order (AEIOUaeiou).

This avoids explicitly sorting extracted vowels, and runs in linear time.
