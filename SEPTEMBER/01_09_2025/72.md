**Understand**
Given two strings `word1` and `word2` return the minimum number of oprations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.
You can perform these operations:
- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

**Example**
Input: `word1` = `horse`, `word2` = `ros`
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')

**Match**
The question is an optimization problem to find the minimum number of changes out of many to change a word to the other word. The optimized solution would be dynamic programming but this solution would make use of recursive backtracking a brute force approach to finding theminimum number of operations to be made to turn word1 into word2.
