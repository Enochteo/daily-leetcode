## Redundant Connection
**Understand**

We are given an undirected graph with n nodes initially forming a tree (connected and acyclic). An extra edge is added, creating a cycle.

We must return the edge that creates the cycle. If multiple answers exist, return the one that appears last in the input.

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
