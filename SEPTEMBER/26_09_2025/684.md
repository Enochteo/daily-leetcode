## Redundant Connection
**Understand**

We are given an undirected graph with n nodes initially forming a tree (connected and acyclic). An extra edge is added, creating a cycle.

We must return the edge that creates the cycle. If multiple answers exist, return the one that appears last in the input.

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Match**

This is a cycle detection problem in an undirected graph.

Use Disjoint Set Union (DSU) / Union-Find.

For each edge (u, v):

If u and v are already connected, this edge is redundant.

Otherwise, union them.

**Plan**

Initialize DSU with parent[i] = i, rank[i] = 1.

Define find(node) with path compression.

Define union(n1, n2) with union by rank:

If roots are equal, return False (edge is redundant).

Else attach smaller tree under larger and update rank.

Return True.

Iterate over edges:

If union(a, b) returns False → return [a, b].

**Implement**
```py
class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(edges)
        rank = [1 for _ in range(n+1)]
        parent = [i for i in range(n+1)]

        def find(node):
            p = parent[node]
            while p != parent[p]:
                parent[p] = parent[parent[p]]  # path compression
                p = parent[p]
            return p
        
        def union(n1, n2):
            p1, p2 = find(n1), find(n2)
            if p1 == p2:
                return False
            if rank[p1] > rank[p2]:
                parent[p2] = p1
                rank[p1] += rank[p2]
            else:
                parent[p1] = p2
                rank[p2] += rank[p1]
            return True

        for a, b in edges:
            if not union(a, b):
                return [a, b]
```

**Review**

DSU ensures efficient cycle detection.

Path compression (parent[p] = parent[parent[p]]) flattens tree structure.

Union by rank balances tree depth.

Returns the first edge that closes a cycle.

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: O(n α(n)) ≈ O(n), where α is inverse Ackermann function (very small) -> O(1).

Space Complexity: O(n) for parent and rank arrays.

**Pattern to remember**

For detecting redundant connections in an undirected graph:

Use Union-Find.

If two nodes already share a root, the edge is redundant.

Return the edge immediately when union fails.
