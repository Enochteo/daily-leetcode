## Redundant Connection
**Understand**

We are given an undirected graph with n nodes initially forming a tree (connected and acyclic). An extra edge is added, creating a cycle.

We must return the edge that creates the cycle. If multiple answers exist, return the one that appears last in the input.

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Match**

This is a cycle detection problem in an undirected graph.

Use Disjoint Set Union (DSU) / Union-Find.

For each edge (u, v):

If u and v are already connected, this edge is redundant.

Otherwise, union them.

**Plan**

Initialize DSU with parent[i] = i, rank[i] = 1.

Define find(node) with path compression.

Define union(n1, n2) with union by rank:

If roots are equal, return False (edge is redundant).

Else attach smaller tree under larger and update rank.

Return True.

Iterate over edges:

If union(a, b) returns False â†’ return [a, b].
