## Find Eventual Safe States
**Understand**

We are given a directed graph where graph[i] is the list of nodes that node i points to.

A node is eventually safe if every possible path starting from that node ends in a terminal node (a node with no outgoing edges), i.e., no path leads into a cycle.

We must return all safe nodes in ascending order.

**Match**

This is a graph cycle detection problem.

Unsafe nodes are those that are part of or lead into cycles.

Use DFS with recursion + visited set to detect cycles.

Maintain two sets:

safe: nodes proven to be safe.

unsafe: nodes proven to be unsafe.
