## Find Eventual Safe States
**Understand**

We are given a directed graph where graph[i] is the list of nodes that node i points to.

A node is eventually safe if every possible path starting from that node ends in a terminal node (a node with no outgoing edges), i.e., no path leads into a cycle.

We must return all safe nodes in ascending order.
