## All Paths From Source to Target
**Understand**

We are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) represented as an adjacency list graph, where graph[i] is the list of nodes directly reachable from node i.

We need to return all possible paths from source node 0 to target node n-1.

**Match**

This is a graph traversal with path tracking problem.

Because the graph is a DAG, there are no cycles.

DFS with backtracking (or recursion building paths) is natural.

Each time we reach the target node, record the current path.

**Plan**

Set src = 0 and target = n-1.

Define recursive DFS dfs(node, path):

If node == target, append a copy of path to result.

Otherwise, for each neighbor in graph[node], recurse with path + [nei].

Start DFS with (src, [src]).

Return res containing all valid paths.
