## Regular Expression Matching
**Understand**

We need to implement regex matching with support for:

. → matches any single character.

* → matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The entire string s must be matched by pattern p.

**Match**

This is a dynamic programming (DP) problem with recursion + memoization.

Direct recursion explores all matches.

* introduces branching: skip the x* (zero occurrences) or consume one character (if match).

Memoization (lru_cache) ensures subproblems are not recomputed.
