## Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To

**Understand**

We are given an array groupSizes where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that person i belongs to.
We need to partition people into groups so that:

Each group has exactly the size specified for its members.

Every person is placed into exactly one group.

**Match**

This is a hash map bucketing problem.

Use a dictionary keyed by group size.

Collect people until a bucket reaches its group size, then flush it into results.

**Plan**

Initialize my_dict = defaultdict(list) and res = [].

Loop through groupSizes with index i:

Append i to my_dict[grp] where grp = groupSizes[i].

If bucket size == grp, append it to result and reset the bucket.

Return res.

**Implement**
```py
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def groupThePeople(self, groupSizes: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        my_dict = defaultdict(list)
        res = []
        for i, grp in enumerate(groupSizes):
            my_dict[grp].append(i)
            if len(my_dict[grp]) == grp:
                res.append(my_dict[grp])
                my_dict[grp] = []
        return res
```

**Review**

Each group is flushed exactly when it reaches required size.

Ensures all people are grouped without leftovers.

Dictionary prevents mixing group sizes.

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: O(n), where n = number of people.

Space Complexity: O(n), for dictionary storage and result list.
