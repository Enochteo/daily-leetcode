## Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To

**Understand**

We are given an array groupSizes where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that person i belongs to.
We need to partition people into groups so that:

Each group has exactly the size specified for its members.

Every person is placed into exactly one group.

**Match**

This is a hash map bucketing problem.

Use a dictionary keyed by group size.

Collect people until a bucket reaches its group size, then flush it into results.
