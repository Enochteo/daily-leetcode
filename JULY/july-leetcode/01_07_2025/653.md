## Two Sum IV â€“ Input is a BST
Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k.

**Understand**
You're given a Binary Search Tree (TreeNode root) and a target sum k.

Return True if two nodes exist such that node1.val + node2.val == k.

**Match**
This is a variant of the classic Two Sum problem:

Use DFS or BFS to traverse the tree.

Use a set to track seen values.

For each node, check if (k - node.val) exists in the set.

**Plan**
Initialize a set to store visited node values.

Perform DFS traversal of the tree:

At each node, check if k - node.val exists in the set.

If yes, return True.

If not, add node.val to the set and recurse left and right.

If no such pair is found, return False.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findTarget(self, root, k):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        seen = set()
        
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:
                return False
            if k - node.val in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(node.val)
            return dfs(node.left) or dfs(node.right)
        
        return dfs(root)
```

**Review**
Traverses all nodes once.

Efficiently checks complement using a set.

Elegant use of recursion (DFS).

Fulfills Two Sum check without needing to convert BST to array.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity:

O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.

Space Complexity:

O(n) for the hash set storing visited node values and recursion stack (in worst case of skewed tree).
