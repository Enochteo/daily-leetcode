## Average of Levels in Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of a list.

**Understand**
You're given a binary tree and asked to compute the average value of all nodes at each depth level (i.e., level 0, level 1, level 2, etc.).

**Example**:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [3.0, 14.5, 11.0]
Each level of the tree is:

Level 0: [3] → Average: 3.0

Level 1: [9, 20] → Average: 14.5

Level 2: [15, 7] → Average: 11.0
