## Average of Levels in Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of a list.

**Understand**
You're given a binary tree and asked to compute the average value of all nodes at each depth level (i.e., level 0, level 1, level 2, etc.).

**Example**:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [3.0, 14.5, 11.0]
Each level of the tree is:

Level 0: [3] → Average: 3.0

Level 1: [9, 20] → Average: 14.5

Level 2: [15, 7] → Average: 11.0

**Match**
This is a level-order traversal problem, best solved using BFS (Breadth-First Search) with a queue.

Tree traversal → BFS

Track nodes by level → use deque

Accumulate node values at each level → compute average

**Plan**
Initialize a result list res to hold level averages.

Use a queue to perform BFS starting from the root.

For each level:

Process all nodes currently in the queue.

Collect their values in a nodes list.

Add their children to the queue.

Compute and store the average of nodes.

Return the result list after traversal.

**Implement**
```python
from collections import deque

class Solution(object):
    def averageOfLevels(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: List[float]
        """
        if not root:
            return []
        
        res = []
        queue = deque([root])
        
        while queue:
            nodes = []
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                nodes.append(node.val)
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            res.append(sum(nodes) * 1.0 / len(nodes))
        
        return res
```

**Review**
Uses BFS correctly.

Keeps track of level sizes and computes per-level averages.

Casts result to float to ensure correct output format.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity:

O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.

Space Complexity:

O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree (i.e., the maximum number of nodes at any level), used by the queue.
