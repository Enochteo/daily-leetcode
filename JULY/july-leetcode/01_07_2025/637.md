## Average of Levels in Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of a list.

**Understand**
You're given a binary tree and asked to compute the average value of all nodes at each depth level (i.e., level 0, level 1, level 2, etc.).

**Example**:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [3.0, 14.5, 11.0]
Each level of the tree is:

Level 0: [3] → Average: 3.0

Level 1: [9, 20] → Average: 14.5

Level 2: [15, 7] → Average: 11.0

**Match**
This is a level-order traversal problem, best solved using BFS (Breadth-First Search) with a queue.

Tree traversal → BFS

Track nodes by level → use deque

Accumulate node values at each level → compute average

**Plan**
Initialize a result list res to hold level averages.

Use a queue to perform BFS starting from the root.

For each level:

Process all nodes currently in the queue.

Collect their values in a nodes list.

Add their children to the queue.

Compute and store the average of nodes.

Return the result list after traversal.
