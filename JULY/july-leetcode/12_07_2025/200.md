##  Number of Islands
**Understand**
Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

**Match**
Pattern: DFS / Graph Traversal on Matrix

Use DFS to "flood fill" all land connected to each unvisited '1'.

**Plan**
Iterate through the grid.

If a cell contains '1' and hasn't been visited:

Increment the island count.

Start a DFS to visit all connected land cells.

In the DFS:

Mark cell as visited.

Recursively explore its 4 neighbors.
