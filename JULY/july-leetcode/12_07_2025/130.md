## Surrounded Regions
**Understand**
Youâ€™re given a 2D board of 'X' and 'O'. Capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's that are completely surrounded by 'X' to 'X'.
Note: Border-connected 'O's should not be flipped.

**Match**
Pattern: DFS Matrix Region Flood-Fill

Similar to: Number of Islands, Flood Fill, Walls and Gates

**Plan**
DFS from all 'O's on the border and mark them temporarily as 'T'.

After that:

Flip all remaining 'O's to 'X' (since they are enclosed).

Restore all 'T's back to 'O'.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def solve(self, board):
        rows = len(board)
        cols = len(board[0])

        def dfs(r, c):
            if (r < 0 or c < 0 or r == rows or c == cols 
                or board[r][c] == "X" or board[r][c] == "T"):
                return 
            board[r][c] = "T"
            dfs(r+1, c)
            dfs(r-1, c)
            dfs(r, c+1)
            dfs(r, c-1)

        # Step 1: mark border-connected 'O's
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if board[r][c] == "O" and (r == 0 or c == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == cols - 1):
                    dfs(r, c)

        # Step 2: flip enclosed 'O's to 'X' and restore 'T' to 'O'
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if board[r][c] == "O":
                    board[r][c] = "X"
                elif board[r][c] == "T":
                    board[r][c] = "O"
```
