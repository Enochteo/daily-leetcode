## Surrounded Regions
**Understand**
Youâ€™re given a 2D board of 'X' and 'O'. Capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's that are completely surrounded by 'X' to 'X'.
Note: Border-connected 'O's should not be flipped.

**Match**
Pattern: DFS Matrix Region Flood-Fill

Similar to: Number of Islands, Flood Fill, Walls and Gates

**Plan**
DFS from all 'O's on the border and mark them temporarily as 'T'.

After that:

Flip all remaining 'O's to 'X' (since they are enclosed).

Restore all 'T's back to 'O'.
