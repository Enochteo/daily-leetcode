**Understand**
Youâ€™re given the root of a binary tree.

A binary tree is height-balanced if for every node:

The difference between the height of the left and right subtree is at most 1.

Goal: Return True if the tree is balanced, else return False.

**Match**
This problem relates to:

Binary Tree DFS

Postorder traversal (bottom-up)

Early stopping with special values (e.g., returning -1 for imbalance)

**Plan**
Use a recursive DFS function to compute the height of the left and right subtrees.

If at any point the height difference > 1, return -1 to signal imbalance.

If the subtree is balanced, return its height.

At the root, if result is not -1, the whole tree is balanced.
