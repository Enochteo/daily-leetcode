**Understand**
You’re given the root of a binary tree.

A binary tree is height-balanced if for every node:

The difference between the height of the left and right subtree is at most 1.

Goal: Return True if the tree is balanced, else return False.

**Match**
This problem relates to:

Binary Tree DFS

Postorder traversal (bottom-up)

Early stopping with special values (e.g., returning -1 for imbalance)

**Plan**
Use a recursive DFS function to compute the height of the left and right subtrees.

If at any point the height difference > 1, return -1 to signal imbalance.

If the subtree is balanced, return its height.

At the root, if result is not -1, the whole tree is balanced.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isBalanced(self, root):
        """
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 0
            left = dfs(root.left)
            if left == -1:
                return -1
            right = dfs(root.right)
            if right == -1:
                return -1
            if abs(left - right) > 1:
                return -1
            return 1 + max(left, right)

        return dfs(root) != -1
```

**Review**
Elegant use of -1 as a signal for imbalance (short-circuits further DFS).

Avoids redundant height calculations.

Works in one bottom-up traversal.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n) — visits each node once

Space Complexity: O(h) — height of recursion stack, O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) for skewed ones
