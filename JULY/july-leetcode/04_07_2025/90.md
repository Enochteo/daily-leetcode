## Subsets II
This problem generates all unique subsets of a list of integers that may contain duplicates. It uses DFS with backtracking, along with sorting and a duplicate-skip condition to avoid repeated subsets.

**Understand**
Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possible unique subsets (the power set).

Example:
Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
Duplicates in the input must not lead to duplicate subsets in the output.
