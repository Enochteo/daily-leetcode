## Kth Largest Element in a Stream
This problem involves maintaining the Kth largest element in a stream of integers. We solve it efficiently using a min heap of size k.

**Understand**
You are given an integer k and an initial list of numbers nums.
Design a class KthLargest with two methods:

__init__(k, nums): Initializes the object with the list.

add(val): Adds a new number and returns the kth largest number in the stream.

**Match**
This problem fits the Heap pattern, specifically:

Maintain a min heap of size k.

The top of the min heap is the kth largest element in the stream.

**Plan**
Store the initial nums in a min heap.

If the heap exceeds size k, remove the smallest (top) element.

For each call to add(val):

    - Push val into the heap.

    - If the heap exceeds k, pop the smallest.

    - Return the smallest element in the heap (minheap[0]), which is the kth largest overall.
