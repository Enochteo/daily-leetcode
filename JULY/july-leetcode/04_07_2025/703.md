## Kth Largest Element in a Stream
This problem involves maintaining the Kth largest element in a stream of integers. We solve it efficiently using a min heap of size k.

**Understand**
You are given an integer k and an initial list of numbers nums.
Design a class KthLargest with two methods:

__init__(k, nums): Initializes the object with the list.

add(val): Adds a new number and returns the kth largest number in the stream.

**Match**
This problem fits the Heap pattern, specifically:

Maintain a min heap of size k.

The top of the min heap is the kth largest element in the stream.

**Plan**
Store the initial nums in a min heap.

If the heap exceeds size k, remove the smallest (top) element.

For each call to add(val):

    - Push val into the heap.

    - If the heap exceeds k, pop the smallest.

    - Return the smallest element in the heap (minheap[0]), which is the kth largest overall.

**Implement**
```python
import heapq

class KthLargest(object):
    def __init__(self, k, nums):
        self.k = k
        self.minheap = nums
        heapq.heapify(self.minheap)
        while len(self.minheap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minheap)

    def add(self, val):
        heapq.heappush(self.minheap, val)
        if len(self.minheap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minheap)
        return self.minheap[0]
```

**Review**
The min heap stores the top k largest elements.

The smallest among them (at the top of the heap) is the kth largest overall.

Pushing and popping from the heap takes O(log k) time.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity:

__init__: O(n log n) to heapify and trim

add: O(log k)

Space Complexity: O(k) for the heap
