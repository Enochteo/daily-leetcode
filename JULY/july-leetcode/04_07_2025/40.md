## Combination Sum II
Find all unique combinations in candidates where the numbers sum to target. Each number in candidates may only be used once. The input may contain duplicates, but each combination must be unique.

**Understand**
Input:

List of integers candidates (may contain duplicates)

Integer target

Goal:

Return unique combinations where the sum equals target

Each number can only be used once in a combination

Example:
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8  
Output: [[1,1,6],[1,2,5],[1,7],[2,6]]

**Match**
This is a:

Backtracking (DFS) problem

With duplicate removal

No reuse of elements â€” move to next index in recursion

**Plan**
Sort candidates to group duplicates.

Use DFS with backtracking:

Base case: If total == target, add a copy of current path curr.

Terminate if total > target or i goes out of bounds.

Iterate from index i to end:

Skip duplicates: if j > i and candidates[j] == candidates[j-1]

Include candidates[j], recurse from j+1 (no reuse).

Backtrack by popping the last element.
