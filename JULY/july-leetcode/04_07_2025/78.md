## Subsets I
This problem generates all possible subsets (the power set) of a list of distinct integers. We solve it using depth-first search (DFS) and backtracking.

**Understand**
Given a list of distinct integers nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).
The solution must not contain duplicate subsets.

**Example**:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

**Match**
This is a classic:

Backtracking / DFS problem

Each element has two choices: include it or exclude it

**Plan**
Use DFS with a helper function that tracks:

Current index in nums

Current subset being built

At each index:

Include the element and recurse

Exclude the element (backtrack) and recurse

When you reach the end, add a copy of the subset to the result list.
