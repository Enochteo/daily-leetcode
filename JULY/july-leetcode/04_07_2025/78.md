## Subsets I
This problem generates all possible subsets (the power set) of a list of distinct integers. We solve it using depth-first search (DFS) and backtracking.

**Understand**
Given a list of distinct integers nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).
The solution must not contain duplicate subsets.

**Example**:
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[3],[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
