## Combination Sum
This problem generates all unique combinations of candidates where the numbers sum up to target. Each number may be used unlimited times.

**Understand**
You're given an array of positive integers candidates and a target integer. Return all unique combinations that sum up to the target. You may reuse elements in the array as many times as needed.

Example:
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]

**Match**
This problem fits:

Backtracking (DFS) with decision trees

Repeated elements allowed in combination

Track sum to decide base/termination case

**Plan**
Use DFS from index i, tracking current path curr and total.

Base case:

If total == target: add a copy of curr to result.

If total > target or index exceeds list: return.

Recursive case:

Include candidates[i] and recurse (since we can reuse it).

Backtrack and skip to next index (not reuse).

**Implement**
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        def dfs(i, curr, total):
            if total == target:
                res.append(curr.copy())
                return
            if i >= len(candidates) or total > target:
                return
            # include current number
            curr.append(candidates[i])
            dfs(i, curr, total + candidates[i])
            # backtrack
            curr.pop()
            # skip current number
            dfs(i + 1, curr, total)
        dfs(0, [], 0)
        return res
```
