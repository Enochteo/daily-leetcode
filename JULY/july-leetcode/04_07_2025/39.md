## Combination Sum
This problem generates all unique combinations of candidates where the numbers sum up to target. Each number may be used unlimited times.

**Understand**
You're given an array of positive integers candidates and a target integer. Return all unique combinations that sum up to the target. You may reuse elements in the array as many times as needed.

Example:
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]

**Match**
This problem fits:
