## Subtree of Another Tree
This problem checks if a given binary tree subRoot is a subtree of another binary tree root. The solution uses recursion to compare each subtree of root with subRoot.

**Understand**
You are given two binary trees: root and subRoot. A subtree of a tree T is a tree consisting of a node in T and all of that node’s descendants.

Your task is to return True if subRoot is a subtree of root.

**Match**
This problem fits the Tree Traversal with Recursive Comparison pattern:

Check every node in the larger tree (root) for a match.

Use a helper function to compare two trees for equality.

Use DFS to traverse all possible subtrees.

**Plan**
Base case:

If subRoot is None, it’s always a subtree.

If root is None but subRoot is not, return False.

Use a helper function isIdentical to check if two trees are exactly the same.

At every node in root, check if:

isIdentical(root, subRoot) is True, return True.

Otherwise, recursively check root.left and root.right.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isSubtree(self, root, subRoot):
        if root and not subRoot:
            return False
        if subRoot and not root:
            return False
        def isIdentical(root, subRoot):
            if not root and not subRoot:
                return True
            if not root or not subRoot:
                return False
            return (root.val == subRoot.val and 
                    isIdentical(root.left, subRoot.left) and 
                    isIdentical(root.right, subRoot.right))
        if isIdentical(root, subRoot):
            return True
        return self.isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) or self.isSubtree(root.right, subRoot)
```

**Review**
The helper function ensures a complete structure and value match.

The recursion checks every possible subtree in root.

The base cases are clearly handled for edge conditions.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(m * n) in the worst case, where m is the number of nodes in root and n is in subRoot.

Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (root), due to recursion stack.
