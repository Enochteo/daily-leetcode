## Subtree of Another Tree
This problem checks if a given binary tree subRoot is a subtree of another binary tree root. The solution uses recursion to compare each subtree of root with subRoot.

**Understand**
You are given two binary trees: root and subRoot. A subtree of a tree T is a tree consisting of a node in T and all of that node’s descendants.

Your task is to return True if subRoot is a subtree of root.

**Match**
This problem fits the Tree Traversal with Recursive Comparison pattern:

Check every node in the larger tree (root) for a match.

Use a helper function to compare two trees for equality.

Use DFS to traverse all possible subtrees.

**Plan**
Base case:

If subRoot is None, it’s always a subtree.

If root is None but subRoot is not, return False.

Use a helper function isIdentical to check if two trees are exactly the same.

At every node in root, check if:

isIdentical(root, subRoot) is True, return True.

Otherwise, recursively check root.left and root.right.
