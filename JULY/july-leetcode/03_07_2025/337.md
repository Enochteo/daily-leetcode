## House Robber III
This problem is a variation of the House Robber problem, adapted to a binary tree. You are not allowed to rob directly-connected houses (parent and child). The solution applies a post-order DFS with dynamic programming.

**Understand**
You're given the root of a binary tree. Each node represents a house with some amount of money.
You cannot rob two directly-linked houses (i.e., parent and child).

Goal: Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.

**Match**
This problem matches the Tree DP with Post-order Traversal pattern:

Use DFS to traverse the tree

At each node, compute two values:

rob: maximum money if the current node is robbed

not_rob: maximum money if the current node is not robbed

Reuse subproblem solutions (left and right child)
