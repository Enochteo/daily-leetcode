## House Robber III
This problem is a variation of the House Robber problem, adapted to a binary tree. You are not allowed to rob directly-connected houses (parent and child). The solution applies a post-order DFS with dynamic programming.

**Understand**
You're given the root of a binary tree. Each node represents a house with some amount of money.
You cannot rob two directly-linked houses (i.e., parent and child).

Goal: Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.

**Match**
This problem matches the Tree DP with Post-order Traversal pattern:

Use DFS to traverse the tree

At each node, compute two values:

rob: maximum money if the current node is robbed

not_rob: maximum money if the current node is not robbed

Reuse subproblem solutions (left and right child)

**Plan**
Define a helper function dfs(node) that returns a 2-element array:
[rob, not_rob]

rob: max money if we rob the current node

not_rob: max money if we do not rob the current node

For each node:

If we rob it, we can't rob its children.
So, rob = node.val + left[1] + right[1]

If we donâ€™t rob it, we can take the max of rob/not_rob from its children.
So, not_rob = max(left) + max(right)

Use post-order traversal (bottom-up) to calculate values from children to parent.

Return the maximum of rob and not_rob at the root.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, root):
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return [0, 0]  # [rob, not_rob]
            left = dfs(root.left)
            right = dfs(root.right)

            rob = root.val + left[1] + right[1]
            not_rob = max(left) + max(right)

            return [rob, not_rob]
        
        return max(dfs(root))
```

**Review**
The recursive calls return both states (robbed and not robbed).

Efficiently avoids repeated calculation by separating choices.

Post-order traversal ensures that child values are known before processing the parent.
