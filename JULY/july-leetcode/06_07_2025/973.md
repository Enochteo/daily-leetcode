## Unique Binary Search Trees
**Understand**
Given n, the number of distinct nodes (1 to n), how many structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs) can be formed?

**Match**
This is a Catalan number problem.

Classic Dynamic Programming pattern:
Let G(n) be the number of unique BSTs with n nodes.

For each root i, left subtree has i-1 nodes, right has n-i.

**Plan**
Initialize a DP array uniq_tree of size n+1 with base cases:

uniq_tree[0] = 1, uniq_tree[1] = 1
