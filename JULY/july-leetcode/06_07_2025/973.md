## Unique Binary Search Trees
**Understand**
Given n, the number of distinct nodes (1 to n), how many structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs) can be formed?

**Match**
This is a Catalan number problem.

Classic Dynamic Programming pattern:
Let G(n) be the number of unique BSTs with n nodes.

For each root i, left subtree has i-1 nodes, right has n-i.

**Plan**
Initialize a DP array uniq_tree of size n+1 with base cases:

uniq_tree[0] = 1, uniq_tree[1] = 1

For each number of nodes 2...n:

Try each node 1...nodes as root:

Multiply number of left and right subtrees (uniq_tree[left] * uniq_tree[right])

Store the sum in uniq_tree[nodes]

Return uniq_tree[n]

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def numTrees(self, n):
        uniq_tree = [1] * (n + 1)
        for nodes in range(2, n + 1):
            total = 0
            for root in range(1, nodes + 1):
                total += uniq_tree[root - 1] * uniq_tree[nodes - root]
            uniq_tree[nodes] = total
        return uniq_tree[n]
```

**Review**
Dynamic programming table used to avoid recomputation.

Matches Catalan number formula.

Handles edge case n = 0 properly.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)

Space Complexity: O(n)
