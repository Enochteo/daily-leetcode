##  Group Anagrams

**Understand**
You’re given a list of strings.
Your task is to group the anagrams together.

Anagrams are strings that contain the same characters with the same frequency, possibly in a different order.
Example: "eat", "tea", and "ate" are all anagrams of each other.

**Match**
This is a:

Hashing problem

Anagram detection problem

Frequency array optimization problem

You can’t just sort every string if performance matters. A frequency map or count tuple is often more efficient.
