##  Group Anagrams

**Understand**
You’re given a list of strings.
Your task is to group the anagrams together.

Anagrams are strings that contain the same characters with the same frequency, possibly in a different order.
Example: "eat", "tea", and "ate" are all anagrams of each other.

**Match**
This is a:

Hashing problem

Anagram detection problem

Frequency array optimization problem

You can’t just sort every string if performance matters. A frequency map or count tuple is often more efficient.

**Plan**
Use a defaultdict(list) to collect anagrams.

For each string:

Build a character count array of length 26 (assuming lowercase English letters).

Convert this list into a tuple (hashable) to use as the key.

Append the string to the corresponding group.

Return the list of all grouped values.

**Implement**
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        res = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26  # frequency array for each letter a-z
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
            res[tuple(count)].append(s)
            return list(res.values())
```
**Review**
Tuple of character counts ensures anagrams hash to the same key.Review
Tuple of character counts ensures anagrams hash to the same key.

Avoids sorting each string (O(n log n)), saving time.

Handles edge cases like empty strings and single-letter words.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n * k)
where n = len(strs) and k = average length of strings.
Each string is scanned once to build a frequency count.

Space Complexity: O(n * k)
for storing the result and the frequency keys in the hash map.


**Pattern to Remember By**
Use a fixed-size frequency array as a signature for anagram detection, instead of sorting the string.
