## Design Twitter
**Understand**
Design a Twitter-like system with the following features:

postTweet(userId, tweetId): Post a new tweet.

getNewsFeed(userId): Retrieve the 10 most recent tweet IDs from the user and users they follow.

follow(followerId, followeeId): Follower starts following followee.

unfollow(followerId, followeeId): Follower stops following followee.

**Match**
- Object-oriented design

- Data Structures:

HashMap for users

Set for following relationships

Min heap for top tweets

Algorithm: Timestamped sorting + heap

**Plan**
Use a User class that stores posts and follows.

Maintain a global timestamp for tweet ordering.

On getNewsFeed, combine tweets of user and followed users, heapify by timestamp, return top 10.

Ensure user accounts are created if they donâ€™t exist on any action.
