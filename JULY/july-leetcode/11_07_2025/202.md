##  Happy Number
**Understand**
Given a number, repeatedly replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits. If it eventually becomes 1, it's a "happy number." If it loops endlessly without reaching 1, it’s not.

**Match**
Pattern: Cycle detection in sequences (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare)

Similar to cycle detection in linked lists

**Plan**
Define a helper function to calculate the sum of the squares of digits.

Use two pointers (slow, fast) to simulate cycle detection:

slow moves one step (once per sum-of-squares).

fast moves two steps (twice per sum-of-squares).

If fast ever reaches 1, return True.

If slow equals fast and is not 1, a cycle exists — return False.
