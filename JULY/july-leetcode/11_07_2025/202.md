##  Happy Number
**Understand**
Given a number, repeatedly replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits. If it eventually becomes 1, it's a "happy number." If it loops endlessly without reaching 1, it’s not.

**Match**
Pattern: Cycle detection in sequences (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare)

Similar to cycle detection in linked lists

**Plan**
Define a helper function to calculate the sum of the squares of digits.

Use two pointers (slow, fast) to simulate cycle detection:

slow moves one step (once per sum-of-squares).

fast moves two steps (twice per sum-of-squares).

If fast ever reaches 1, return True.

If slow equals fast and is not 1, a cycle exists — return False.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        def sum_of_squares(n):
            squares = 0
            while n:
                digit = n % 10
                squares += digit**2
                n = n // 10
            return squares 
        
        slow = fast = n
        while fast != 1:
            fast = sum_of_squares(sum_of_squares(fast))
            slow = sum_of_squares(slow)
            if fast == slow and slow != 1:
                return False
        return True
```
