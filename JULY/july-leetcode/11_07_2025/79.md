## Word Search
**Understand**
Given a 2D board of characters and a word, determine if the word exists in the grid. Letters must be adjacent horizontally or vertically. The same cell cannot be used more than once in a path.

**Match**
Problem Type: Matrix search, DFS, Backtracking

Pattern: Recursively explore paths in a matrix, tracking visited cells

**Plan**
Iterate over every cell in the grid.

Start DFS from each cell:

If the character matches the current letter in the word, continue.

Track visited cells to avoid reuse.

Try all four directions: up, down, left, right.

Use backtracking to explore all options.

If any path returns true, return true. Otherwise, return false.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def exist(self, board, word):
        """
        :type board: List[List[str]]
        :type word: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        self.rows = len(board)
        self.cols = len(board[0])
        visited = set()

        def dfs(i, j, k):
            if k == len(word):
                return True
            if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= self.rows or j >= self.cols:
                return False
            if (i, j) in visited or board[i][j] != word[k]:
                return False

            visited.add((i, j))
            result = (
                dfs(i + 1, j, k + 1) or
                dfs(i - 1, j, k + 1) or
                dfs(i, j + 1, k + 1) or
                dfs(i, j - 1, k + 1)
            )
            visited.remove((i, j))
            return result

        for r in range(self.rows):
            for c in range(self.cols):
                if dfs(r, c, 0):
                    return True
        return False
```
**Review**
Correctly handles edge cases and bounds

Properly uses backtracking to explore all possibilities

Efficient with pruning via visited set

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(N * 3^L), where N is number of cells and L is length of the word

Space Complexity: O(L) for the recursion stack and visited path

**Pattern to remember by:**
DFS with backtracking and visited set to find word path in grid
