## Word Search
**Understand**
Given a 2D board of characters and a word, determine if the word exists in the grid. Letters must be adjacent horizontally or vertically. The same cell cannot be used more than once in a path.

**Match**
Problem Type: Matrix search, DFS, Backtracking

Pattern: Recursively explore paths in a matrix, tracking visited cells

**Plan**
Iterate over every cell in the grid.

Start DFS from each cell:

If the character matches the current letter in the word, continue.

Track visited cells to avoid reuse.

Try all four directions: up, down, left, right.

Use backtracking to explore all options.

If any path returns true, return true. Otherwise, return false.
