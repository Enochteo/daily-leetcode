## Reverse Linked List II
**Understand**
You're given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right. Reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the modified list.

The positions are 1-indexed.

Only the sublist between left and right (inclusive) is reversed.

Do not use extra space for another list.

**Match**
This problem is a linked list reversal variant with bounded start and end positions. Classic features:

In-place modification.

Two-pointer traversal.

Requires maintaining connections before and after the reversed sublist.

Similar to:

Reverse entire linked list

Reverse K-group nodes in linked list

**Plan**
Use a dummy node before head to handle edge cases cleanly.

Traverse to the node just before left, saving that node as LeftPrev.

Reverse the sublist from left to right:

Use classic reversal technique with prev, current, and temp.

Connect:

LeftPrev.next to the head of reversed sublist.

Tail of reversed sublist (last) to current (node after right).

Return dummy.next as the new head.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseBetween(self, head, left, right):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :type left: int
        :type right: int
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        current, LeftPrev = head, dummy

        for _ in range(left - 1):
            LeftPrev = current
            current = current.next

        prev = None
        for _ in range(right - left + 1):
            temp = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = temp

        last = LeftPrev.next
        last.next = current
        LeftPrev.next = prev

        return dummy.next
```

**Review**
 Correct handling of edge cases (e.g., reversal at head)

 In-place reversal of a bounded sublist

 Proper reconnection before and after the reversed sublist

 **Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n) – one pass to find left, another to reverse and reconnect.

Space Complexity: O(1) – in-place reversal using constant extra pointers.
