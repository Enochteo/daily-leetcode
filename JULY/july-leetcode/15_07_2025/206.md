## Reverse Linked List II
**Understand**
You're given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right. Reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the modified list.

The positions are 1-indexed.

Only the sublist between left and right (inclusive) is reversed.

Do not use extra space for another list.

**Match**
This problem is a linked list reversal variant with bounded start and end positions. Classic features:

In-place modification.

Two-pointer traversal.

Requires maintaining connections before and after the reversed sublist.

Similar to:

Reverse entire linked list

Reverse K-group nodes in linked list
