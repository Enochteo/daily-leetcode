## Number of Islands
**Understand**
You’re given a 2D grid where:

"1" represents land

"0" represents water

An island is a group of connected land cells (horizontally or vertically).
You need to count how many islands there are.

**Match**
This is a classic graph traversal problem on a grid.

Patterns that match:

Flood fill

DFS/BFS on a matrix

Connected components

**Plan**
Traverse every cell in the grid.

When you find an unvisited "1" (land), it’s the start of a new island.

Use DFS to explore all connected land and mark them as visited.

Count each time you launch DFS from a new unvisited "1".
