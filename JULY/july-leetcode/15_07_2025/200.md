## Number of Islands
**Understand**
You’re given a 2D grid where:

"1" represents land

"0" represents water

An island is a group of connected land cells (horizontally or vertically).
You need to count how many islands there are.

**Match**
This is a classic graph traversal problem on a grid.

Patterns that match:

Flood fill

DFS/BFS on a matrix

Connected components

**Plan**
Traverse every cell in the grid.

When you find an unvisited "1" (land), it’s the start of a new island.

Use DFS to explore all connected land and mark them as visited.

Count each time you launch DFS from a new unvisited "1".

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        islands = 0
        visited = set()
        steps = [(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0, -1)]

        def dfs(r, c):
            if (
                r < 0 or c < 0 or r == rows or c == cols 
                or (r, c) in visited or grid[r][c] == "0"
            ):
                return 
            visited.add((r, c))
            for dr, dc in steps:
                dfs(r + dr, c + dc)

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == "1" and (r, c) not in visited:
                    islands += 1
                    dfs(r, c)

        return islands
```

**Review**
Efficient
Covers all directions
Uses a visited set to avoid cycles
Avoids modifying the original grid

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(m * n), where m is rows and n is columns

Space Complexity: O(m * n) worst-case (visited + recursion stack)
Alternative: Use BFS or in-place marking (e.g., mutate "1" to "0" to avoid extra space).
