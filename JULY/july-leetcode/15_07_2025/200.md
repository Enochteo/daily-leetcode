## Number of Islands
**Understand**
Youâ€™re given a 2D grid where:

"1" represents land

"0" represents water

An island is a group of connected land cells (horizontally or vertically).
You need to count how many islands there are.

**Match**
This is a classic graph traversal problem on a grid.

Patterns that match:

Flood fill

DFS/BFS on a matrix

Connected components
