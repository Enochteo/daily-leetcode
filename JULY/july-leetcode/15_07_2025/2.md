## Add Two Numbers (Leetcode 2)
**Understand**
You're given two non-empty linked lists l1 and l2, representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit.
You must return the sum as a linked list in the same reverse order.

Example
Input: (2 → 4 → 3) + (5 → 6 → 4)
Output: 7 → 0 → 8
Reason: 342 + 465 = 807

**Match**
This is a linked list traversal and arithmetic problem.

Patterns involved:

Iterating over two linked lists

Managing a carry

Constructing a result list via a dummy head node
