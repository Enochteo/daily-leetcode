## Add Two Numbers (Leetcode 2)
**Understand**
You're given two non-empty linked lists l1 and l2, representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit.
You must return the sum as a linked list in the same reverse order.

Example
Input: (2 → 4 → 3) + (5 → 6 → 4)
Output: 7 → 0 → 8
Reason: 342 + 465 = 807

**Match**
This is a linked list traversal and arithmetic problem.

Patterns involved:

Iterating over two linked lists

Managing a carry

Constructing a result list via a dummy head node

**Plan**
Use a dummy node to simplify the result list creation.

Use pointers to iterate over both lists (first and second).

For each pair of digits, add them with any carry.

Create a new node with (sum % 10), and update carry to sum // 10.

If one list is longer, continue processing it.

If a carry remains after both lists, append it as a final node.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        """
        :type l1: Optional[ListNode]
        :type l2: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        first = l1
        second = l2
        current = dummy
        carry = 0

        while first and second:
            total = first.val + second.val + carry
            current.next = ListNode(total % 10)
            carry = total // 10
            first = first.next
            second = second.next
            current = current.next

        while first:
            total = first.val + carry
            current.next = ListNode(total % 10)
            carry = total // 10
            first = first.next
            current = current.next

        while second:
            total = second.val + carry
            current.next = ListNode(total % 10)
            carry = total // 10
            second = second.next
            current = current.next

        if carry:
            current.next = ListNode(carry)

        return dummy.next
```
**Review**
Handles different list lengths

Manages carry properly at every step

Final carry node is appended if needed

Uses dummy node to cleanly manage list creation

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(max(m, n))
(Traverse both lists once, where m and n are lengths of l1 and l2)

Space Complexity: O(max(m, n))
(Result list stores one node per digit in the sum)

**Pattern to remember by:**
Traverse both linked lists with carry and dummy head
