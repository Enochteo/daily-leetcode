## Rotting Oranges
**Understand**
You're given a 2D grid where:

0 = empty cell

1 = fresh orange

2 = rotten orange

Each minute, any fresh orange adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a rotten one becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes until no fresh oranges remain. Return -1 if it's impossible.

**Match**
This is a multi-source BFS problem:

Start from all rotten oranges (2s) at once

Spread the rot simultaneously layer by layer (i.e., level order BFS)

Like Walls and Gates, or Flood Fill

**Plan**
Initialize a queue with all positions of rotten oranges (2)

Count total fresh oranges (1)

Perform BFS from the queue:

For each level, loop through all currently rotten oranges

For each one, spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges and decrement fresh_count

Increment the time counter after each level

If all fresh oranges are rotten (fresh_count == 0), return time; otherwise, return -1

**Implement**
```python
class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        time = 0
        steps = [(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)]
        q = deque()
        fresh_count = 0

        # Step 1: Count fresh oranges and enqueue all rotten ones
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 2:
                    q.append([r, c])
                elif grid[r][c] == 1:
                    fresh_count += 1

        # Step 2: BFS
        while q and fresh_count > 0:
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                row, col = q.popleft()
                for dr, dc in steps:
                    nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:
                        grid[nr][nc] = 2
                        q.append([nr, nc])
                        fresh_count -= 1
            time += 1

        return time if fresh_count == 0 else -1
```
