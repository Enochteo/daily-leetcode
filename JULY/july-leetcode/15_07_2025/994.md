## Rotting Oranges
**Understand**
You're given a 2D grid where:

0 = empty cell

1 = fresh orange

2 = rotten orange

Each minute, any fresh orange adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a rotten one becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes until no fresh oranges remain. Return -1 if it's impossible.

**Match**
This is a multi-source BFS problem:

Start from all rotten oranges (2s) at once

Spread the rot simultaneously layer by layer (i.e., level order BFS)

Like Walls and Gates, or Flood Fill

**Plan**
Initialize a queue with all positions of rotten oranges (2)

Count total fresh oranges (1)

Perform BFS from the queue:

For each level, loop through all currently rotten oranges

For each one, spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges and decrement fresh_count

Increment the time counter after each level

If all fresh oranges are rotten (fresh_count == 0), return time; otherwise, return -1
