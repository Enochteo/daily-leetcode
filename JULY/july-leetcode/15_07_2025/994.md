## Rotting Oranges
**Understand**
You're given a 2D grid where:

0 = empty cell

1 = fresh orange

2 = rotten orange

Each minute, any fresh orange adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a rotten one becomes rotten.
Return the minimum number of minutes until no fresh oranges remain. Return -1 if it's impossible.
