## Decode Ways
**Understand**
You're given a string s containing only digits. Each digit or pair of digits can represent a letter using the mapping '1' -> 'A' to '26' -> 'Z'.

You must return the number of ways to decode the string.

**Match**
This is a classic Dynamic Programming problem with overlapping subproblems. Top-down memoization is well-suited here.
