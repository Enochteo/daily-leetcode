## Maximum Product Subarray
**Understand**
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

**Match**
Dynamic Programming with State Tracking

Track both maximum and minimum products due to the sign-flipping behavior of negative numbers.

**Plan**
Initialize res with the max of nums to handle single-element arrays.

Track two values:

currentMax: the max product ending at current index

currentMin: the min product ending at current index

Iterate through nums, and for each element:

If n == 0, reset currentMin and currentMax to 1.

Temporarily store n * currentMax.

Update currentMax as the maximum of n, n * currentMax, and n * currentMin.

Update currentMin similarly for the minimum.

Update the result (res) with the max of currentMax.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProduct(self, nums):
        res = max(nums)
        currentMin, currentMax = 1, 1
        for n in nums:
            if n == 0:
                currentMin, currentMax = 1, 1
            temp = n * currentMax
            currentMax = max(n * currentMax, n * currentMin, n)
            currentMin = min(temp, n * currentMin, n)
            res = max(res, currentMax)
        return res
```

**Review**
Resets on zero to restart product streaks.

Swaps max/min due to the effect of negative numbers.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

**Pattern to Remember by:**:
Track min/max products to handle negative flips and zero resets
