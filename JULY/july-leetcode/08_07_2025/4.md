## Median of Two Sorted Arrays
**Understand**
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, return the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(min(n, m))), but this solution has the brute force solution of O((n+m)log(m+n)).

**Match**
Basic merging + median finding logic

Brute-force approach using sort after merging

Not the optimal binary search method required by the problem constraints

**Plan**
Merge the two arrays into a single list.

Sort the combined list.

If the total length is even:

Return the average of the two middle elements.

If the total length is odd:

Return the middle element directly as the median.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1, nums2):
        new_list = nums1 + nums2
        new_list.sort()
        if len(new_list) % 2 == 0:
            return (new_list[len(new_list) // 2] + new_list[(len(new_list) // 2) - 1])/2.0
        else:
            return new_list[len(new_list) // 2]/1.0
```

**Review**
Correctly finds the median.

Doesn't meet the time complexity constraint.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O((n + m) log(n + m)) – due to sorting.

Space Complexity: O(n + m) – merged list.
