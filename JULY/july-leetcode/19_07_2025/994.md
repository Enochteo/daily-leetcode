## Rotting Oranges
**Understand**
Youâ€™re given a 2D grid where:

0 = empty cell

1 = fresh orange

2 = rotten orange

Every minute, any fresh orange next to a rotten one becomes rotten.

Goal: Return the minimum number of minutes to rot all fresh oranges. If impossible, return -1.

**Match**
This is a classic:

Multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) problem

Same as:

01 Matrix

Walls and Gates

Flood fill / Zombie infection

Rotting spreads like layers (levels) in BFS
