## Rotting Oranges
**Understand**
Youâ€™re given a 2D grid where:

0 = empty cell

1 = fresh orange

2 = rotten orange

Every minute, any fresh orange next to a rotten one becomes rotten.

Goal: Return the minimum number of minutes to rot all fresh oranges. If impossible, return -1.

**Match**
This is a classic:

Multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) problem

Same as:

01 Matrix

Walls and Gates

Flood fill / Zombie infection

Rotting spreads like layers (levels) in BFS

**Plan**
Initialize a queue with all rotten oranges (value 2).

Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).

For each minute, process all currently rotten oranges in the queue:

Infect their valid neighbors (up/down/left/right).

Add newly rotten oranges to the queue.

Count the minutes passed.

If any fresh oranges remain at the end, return -1.
