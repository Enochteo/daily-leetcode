## Rotting Oranges
**Understand**
You’re given a 2D grid where:

0 = empty cell

1 = fresh orange

2 = rotten orange

Every minute, any fresh orange next to a rotten one becomes rotten.

Goal: Return the minimum number of minutes to rot all fresh oranges. If impossible, return -1.

**Match**
This is a classic:

Multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) problem

Same as:

01 Matrix

Walls and Gates

Flood fill / Zombie infection

Rotting spreads like layers (levels) in BFS

**Plan**
Initialize a queue with all rotten oranges (value 2).

Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).

For each minute, process all currently rotten oranges in the queue:

Infect their valid neighbors (up/down/left/right).

Add newly rotten oranges to the queue.

Count the minutes passed.

If any fresh oranges remain at the end, return -1.

**Implement**
```python
from collections import deque

class Solution(object):
    def orangesRotting(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        q = deque()
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        steps = [(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)]
        fresh = 0
        time = 0

        # Count fresh oranges and enqueue rotten ones
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    fresh += 1
                elif grid[r][c] == 2:
                    q.append((r, c))

        # BFS - rot oranges level by level
        while q and fresh > 0:
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                r, c = q.popleft()
                for dr, dc in steps:
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:
                        grid[nr][nc] = 2
                        q.append((nr, nc))
                        fresh -= 1
            time += 1

        return time if fresh == 0 else -1
```
**Review**
Correctly tracks each level (minute) of BFS.

Handles bounds and skips empty/rotten cells.

Early exit with -1 if some oranges can’t rot.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(m * n)
Every cell is visited once at most.

Space Complexity: O(m * n)
Queue could hold all rotten oranges in worst case.
