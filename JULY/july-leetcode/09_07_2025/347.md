## Top K Frequent Elements
**Understand**
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. The answer can be returned in any order.

**Match**
This is a heap problem. You can solve it efficiently using a frequency map + max heap (or min heap with negated values) to get the top k frequent elements.

**Plan**
Use a Counter to compute the frequency of each element.

Build a max heap using negated frequency values.

Pop the heap k times and store the corresponding elements in the result.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def topKFrequent(self, nums, k):
        frq = Counter(nums)
        freq = [(-y, x) for x, y in frq.items()]
        heapq.heapify(freq)
        res = []
        for _ in range(k):
            res.append(heapq.heappop(freq)[1])
        return res
```

**Review**
Handles cases with ties in frequency.

Efficient due to heap-based extraction of top k elements.


**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n log k), where n is the number of elements in nums.

Space Complexity: O(n), for frequency map and heap.
