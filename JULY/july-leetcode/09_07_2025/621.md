## Task Scheduler
**Understand**
Youâ€™re given a list of CPU tasks represented by characters and a cooldown period n. A task must wait n units before it can be executed again. Return the minimum number of time units to finish all tasks.

**Match**
This is a greedy + heap scheduling problem. Use a max heap to always process the most frequent remaining task first, and a cooldown queue to manage waiting tasks.
