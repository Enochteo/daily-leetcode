## Task Scheduler
**Understand**
You’re given a list of CPU tasks represented by characters and a cooldown period n. A task must wait n units before it can be executed again. Return the minimum number of time units to finish all tasks.

**Match**
This is a greedy + heap scheduling problem. Use a max heap to always process the most frequent remaining task first, and a cooldown queue to manage waiting tasks.

**Plan**
Count frequency of each task.

Use a max heap (simulated using negative values) to track the most frequent tasks.

Use a queue (deque) to store tasks during their cooldown period along with their next valid execution time.

At each time unit:

Pop a task from the heap if available and process it.

If the task still has remaining executions, place it in the cooldown queue.

If any task’s cooldown is over, push it back into the heap.

Repeat until both heap and queue are empty.

Track total time.
