## Min Stack
**Understand**
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

**Match**
This is a design problem where you simulate a stack, but track the minimum value at each step. A supporting stack helps maintain the minimum efficiently.

**Plan**
Use two stacks:

stack: normal values

minVal: at each push, keep the min between current value and previous min

When popping, remove the top from both stacks.

getMin() returns the top of minVal.
