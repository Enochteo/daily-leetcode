## LRU Cache
**Understand**
Design a data structure that follows the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache eviction policy. You must support get(key) and put(key, value) operations in O(1) time.

**Match**
This is a design problem involving:

A hash map for O(1) key access.

A doubly linked list to track recent usage for O(1) insertion and removal.

**Plan**
Use a dictionary lrucache to map keys to ListNode objects.

Use a doubly linked list to track the order of access from least to most recent.

left will be the dummy head (least recently used).

right will be the dummy tail (most recently used).

get(key):

If the key exists, remove the node and reinsert it at the tail (right.prev) to mark it as most recently used.

put(key, val):

Remove the old node if key exists.

Create a new node and insert at the end.

If over capacity, evict the LRU node (left.next).
