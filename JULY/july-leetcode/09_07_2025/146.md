## LRU Cache
**Understand**
Design a data structure that follows the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache eviction policy. You must support get(key) and put(key, value) operations in O(1) time.

**Match**
This is a design problem involving:

A hash map for O(1) key access.

A doubly linked list to track recent usage for O(1) insertion and removal.
