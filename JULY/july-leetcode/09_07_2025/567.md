## Permutation in String
**Understand**
Given two strings s1 and s2, return True if s2 contains a permutation of s1. That is, check if any substring of s2 is an anagram of s1.

**Match**
This is a sliding window + frequency hash map (array) problem. We need to check every window of size len(s1) in s2.

**Plan**
Create a frequency hash (array of size 26) for s1.

Slide a window of size len(s1) across s2.

At each step, compute the hash of the current window in s2 and compare it to s1â€™s hash.

Return True if a match is found; otherwise, return False.
