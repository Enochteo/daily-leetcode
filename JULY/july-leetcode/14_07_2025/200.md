## Number of Islands
**Understand**
Given a 2D grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

**Match**
Pattern: DFS / Graph Traversal on Matrix

Use DFS to "flood fill" all land connected to each unvisited '1'.

**Plan**
Iterate through the grid.

If a cell contains '1' and hasn't been visited:

Increment the island count.

Start a DFS to visit all connected land cells.

In the DFS:

Mark cell as visited.

Recursively explore its 4 neighbors.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        islands = 0
        visited = set()

        def dfs(r, c):
            if (r < 0 or c < 0 or r == rows or c == cols 
                or (r, c) in visited or grid[r][c] == "0"):
                return 
            visited.add((r, c))
            dfs(r+1, c)
            dfs(r-1, c)
            dfs(r, c+1)
            dfs(r, c-1)

        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == "1" and (r, c) not in visited:
                    islands += 1
                    dfs(r, c)

        return islands
```

**Review**
DFS from any unvisited '1' ensures that all connected land is marked.

Visited set prevents redundant work and infinite recursion.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(m * n) — each cell is visited once.

Space Complexity: O(m * n) — worst-case size of visited set and recursion stack.
