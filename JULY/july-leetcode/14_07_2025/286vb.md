## Walls and Gates (Brute Force)
**Understand**
You're given a 2D grid with:

0 = gate

-1 = wall

INF (e.g., 2^31 - 1) = empty room

Goal:
Fill each empty room with the shortest distance to its nearest gate, using valid moves in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).

Constraints:

Modify the grid in-place

If a room cannot reach any gate, leave it as is

**Match**
This problem is similar to:

Shortest path in unweighted graphs

Classic flood fill

Rotting oranges (994. Rotting Oranges)

But in this brute-force version, instead of spreading outward from gates, we:

Start a BFS from each empty room

Check how far it is to reach any gate

**Plan**
For every cell in the grid:

If the cell is an empty room (i.e., > 0)

Run a BFS starting from this room

The moment a gate (0) is found, record the number of steps taken

If no gate is reachable, keep original value

To avoid revisiting nodes in the same path, maintain a visited set inside BFS
