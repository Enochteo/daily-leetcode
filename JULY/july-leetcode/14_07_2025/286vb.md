## Walls and Gates (Brute Force)
**Understand**
You're given a 2D grid with:

0 = gate

-1 = wall

INF (e.g., 2^31 - 1) = empty room

Goal:
Fill each empty room with the shortest distance to its nearest gate, using valid moves in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).

Constraints:

Modify the grid in-place

If a room cannot reach any gate, leave it as is

**Match**
This problem is similar to:

Shortest path in unweighted graphs

Classic flood fill

Rotting oranges (994. Rotting Oranges)

But in this brute-force version, instead of spreading outward from gates, we:

Start a BFS from each empty room

Check how far it is to reach any gate

**Plan**
For every cell in the grid:

If the cell is an empty room (i.e., > 0)

Run a BFS starting from this room

The moment a gate (0) is found, record the number of steps taken

If no gate is reachable, keep original value

To avoid revisiting nodes in the same path, maintain a visited set inside BFS

**Implement**
```python
class Solution:
    def islandsAndTreasure(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        direction = [(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)]
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        def bfs(r,c):
            q = deque([(r,c)])
            steps = 0
            visited = set()
            while q:
                for _ in range(len(q)):
                    row, col = q.popleft()
                    if grid[row][col] == 0:
                        return steps
                    for dr, dc in direction:
                        nr, nc = row + dr, col +dc
                        if nr < 0 or nc < 0 or nr == rows or nc == cols or (nr,nc) in visited or grid[nr][nc] < 0:
                            continue
                        visited.add((nr,nc))
                        q.append((nr,nc))
                steps += 1
            return 0
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] > 0:
                    temp = grid[r][c]
                    new_num = bfs(r,c)
                    grid[r][c] = new_num if new_num > 0 else temp
```

**Evaluate**
Metric	Brute-Force BFS	Optimized BFS (multi-source)
Time Complexity	O((m*n)^2)	O(m * n)
Space Complexity	O(m * n)	O(m * n)

**Patten to remember by:**
Brute force bfs going from each index to the shortest gate
