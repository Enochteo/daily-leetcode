## Walls and Gates (Brute Force)
**Understand**
You're given a 2D grid with:

0 = gate

-1 = wall

INF (e.g., 2^31 - 1) = empty room

Goal:
Fill each empty room with the shortest distance to its nearest gate, using valid moves in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).

Constraints:

Modify the grid in-place

If a room cannot reach any gate, leave it as is
