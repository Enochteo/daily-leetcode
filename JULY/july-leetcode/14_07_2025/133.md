## Clone Graph
**Understand**
You're given a reference to a node in an undirected graph.
Each node has a value and a list of neighbors.
Return a deep copy of the entire graph.

Constraints:

The graph may contain cycles.

Node values are unique but donâ€™t need to be used for comparison.

You must return the same structure (with new node objects).

**Match**
Graph traversal

Pattern: DFS with HashMap for visited tracking and cloning

Similar to: Deep copy, Copy Linked List with Random Pointer

**Plan**
Use a hashe (dictionary) to map original nodes to their clones.

Traverse the graph with DFS:

If a node is not visited, create a copy and recurse on its neighbors.

After all nodes are created, assign correct neighbors using the mapping

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        if not node:
            return None
        hashe = {}
        
        def dfs(n):
            if n in hashe:
                return
            hashe[n] = Node(n.val)
            for neighbor in n.neighbors:
                dfs(neighbor)
        
        dfs(node)
        
        for old_node in hashe:
            hashe[old_node].neighbors = [hashe[n] for n in old_node.neighbors]
        
        return hashe[node]
```

**Review**
Clones all nodes and maps them via hashe.

Prevents cycles by checking hashe before recursion.

Builds neighbor relationships after all nodes are created.
