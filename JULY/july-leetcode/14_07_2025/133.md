## Clone Graph
**Understand**
You're given a reference to a node in an undirected graph.
Each node has a value and a list of neighbors.
Return a deep copy of the entire graph.

Constraints:

The graph may contain cycles.

Node values are unique but donâ€™t need to be used for comparison.

You must return the same structure (with new node objects).

**Match**
Graph traversal

Pattern: DFS with HashMap for visited tracking and cloning

Similar to: Deep copy, Copy Linked List with Random Pointer

**Plan**
Use a hashe (dictionary) to map original nodes to their clones.

Traverse the graph with DFS:

If a node is not visited, create a copy and recurse on its neighbors.

After all nodes are created, assign correct neighbors using the mapping
