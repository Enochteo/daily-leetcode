## Walls and Gates
**Understand**
You're given a 2D grid with:

0 = gate

-1 = wall

INF (e.g., 2^31 - 1) = empty room

Goal:
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate (0), using shortest paths (up/down/left/right).

Constraints:

Modify the grid in-place.

If a room cannot reach any gate, leave it as is.
