## Walls and Gates
**Understand**
You're given a 2D grid with:

0 = gate

-1 = wall

INF (e.g., 2^31 - 1) = empty room

Goal:
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate (0), using shortest paths (up/down/left/right).

Constraints:

Modify the grid in-place.

If a room cannot reach any gate, leave it as is.

**Match**
This is a classic multi-source BFS problem:

All gates are BFS sources.

Spread outwards layer by layer.

Like rotting oranges, flood fill, or shortest path in unweighted grid.

**Plan**
Instead of starting BFS from each room (your current code), we start from all gates (0s) at once:

Use a queue to store all (row, col) positions with value 0.

Run BFS from all gates simultaneously.

For each valid neighbor cell with value INF, update its value to current distance + 1.

This way:

Each room gets the shortest distance to any gate.

More efficient than running BFS from each room.

**Implement**
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        if not rooms:
            return

        rows, cols = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
        queue = deque()

        # Step 1: Add all gates to the queue
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if rooms[r][c] == 0:
                    queue.append((r, c))

        directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]

        # Step 2: BFS from all gates
        while queue:
            r, c = queue.popleft()
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and rooms[nr][nc] == 2147483647:
                    rooms[nr][nc] = rooms[r][c] + 1
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
