## Walls and Gates
**Understand**
You're given a 2D grid with:

0 = gate

-1 = wall

INF (e.g., 2^31 - 1) = empty room

Goal:
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate (0), using shortest paths (up/down/left/right).

Constraints:

Modify the grid in-place.

If a room cannot reach any gate, leave it as is.

**Match**
This is a classic multi-source BFS problem:

All gates are BFS sources.

Spread outwards layer by layer.

Like rotting oranges, flood fill, or shortest path in unweighted grid.

**Plan**
Instead of starting BFS from each room (your current code), we start from all gates (0s) at once:

Use a queue to store all (row, col) positions with value 0.

Run BFS from all gates simultaneously.

For each valid neighbor cell with value INF, update its value to current distance + 1.

This way:

Each room gets the shortest distance to any gate.

More efficient than running BFS from each room.
