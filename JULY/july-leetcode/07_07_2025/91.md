## Decode Ways
**Understand**
You are given a string s containing digits. Each digit or pair of digits can map to letters:

'1' → 'A', '2' → 'B', ..., '26' → 'Z'.

You need to return the number of ways to decode the string.

**Match**
This is a Dynamic Programming problem.

Very similar to the Climbing Stairs pattern:

At every index, decide whether to take 1 digit or 2 digits (if valid).

Invalid cases like '0' need to be handled.

**Plan**
Use bottom-up dynamic programming.

Start from the back of the string, move toward the front.

dp[i] = number of ways to decode from index i to the end.

If current char is '0', dp[i] = 0

Otherwise, dp[i] = dp[i+1]

If the two-digit number starting at i is valid (<= 26), add dp[i+2]

Initialize dp[len(s)] = 1 (empty string base case)

Return dp[0]

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def numDecodings(self, s):
        dp = {len(s): 1}
        for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == "0":
                dp[i] = 0
            else:
                dp[i] = dp[i + 1]
            if i + 1 < len(s) and (s[i] == "1" or s[i] == "2" and s[i + 1] in "0123456"):
                dp[i] += dp[i + 2]
        return dp[0]
```
**Review**
Handles '0' edge cases cleanly.

Efficient: avoids recursion and stack overflow.

Uses hash map for memory-safe indexing.
