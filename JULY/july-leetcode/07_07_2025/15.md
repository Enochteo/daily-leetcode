## 3Sum
**Understand**
Given an integer array nums, return all unique triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that:

i != j, i != k, and j != k

nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Match**
Classic Two-Pointer + Sorting problem.

Variation of 2Sum where we fix the first number and use two pointers to find the other two.

**Plan**
Sort the array.

Iterate through the array with index first.

Skip duplicates for the first element.

Use two pointers l (left) and r (right) to scan the rest of the array.

If the triplet sums to zero, add it to the result.

Skip duplicate elements while moving pointers to avoid repeated triplets.

If the sum is too small, move l right.

If the sum is too large, move r left.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSum(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        res = []
        for first in range(len(nums)):
            if first > 0 and nums[first] == nums[first - 1]:
                continue
            l, r = first + 1, len(nums) - 1
            while l < r:
                total = nums[first] + nums[l] + nums[r]
                if total == 0:
                    res.append([nums[first], nums[l], nums[r]])
                    l += 1
                    while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l - 1]:
                        l += 1
                elif total > 0:
                    r -= 1
                else:
                    l += 1
        return res
```
**Review**
Sorting helps with duplicate handling and efficient pointer traversal.

Skipping duplicates ensures uniqueness.

Carefully structured pointer logic avoids redundant triplets.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)

Space Complexity: O(1) (excluding output)
