## 3Sum
**Understand**
Given an integer array nums, return all unique triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that:

i != j, i != k, and j != k

nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Match**
Classic Two-Pointer + Sorting problem.

Variation of 2Sum where we fix the first number and use two pointers to find the other two.

**Plan**
Sort the array.

Iterate through the array with index first.

Skip duplicates for the first element.

Use two pointers l (left) and r (right) to scan the rest of the array.

If the triplet sums to zero, add it to the result.

Skip duplicate elements while moving pointers to avoid repeated triplets.

If the sum is too small, move l right.

If the sum is too large, move r left.
