## 3Sum
**Understand**
Given an integer array nums, return all unique triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that:

i != j, i != k, and j != k

nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Match**
Classic Two-Pointer + Sorting problem.

Variation of 2Sum where we fix the first number and use two pointers to find the other two.
