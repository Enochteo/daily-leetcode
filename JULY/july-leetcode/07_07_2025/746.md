## Min Cost Climbing Stairs
**Understand**
You're given a list cost where cost[i] is the cost to step on the i-th stair.
You can start from step 0 or step 1, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Return the minimum cost to reach the top (after the last index).

**Match**
Classic Dynamic Programming problem.

Matches the bottom-up DP pattern with in-place updates.

Similar to Climbing Stairs, but we accumulate cost as we go.

**Plan**
Append 0 to cost to represent reaching the top.

Traverse the list in reverse, starting from the third-to-last stair.

For each step i, set cost[i] += min(cost[i+1], cost[i+2]) to update the min cost from that step.

The answer is the minimum of cost[0] and cost[1], since you can start from either step.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost):
        cost.append(0)
        for i in range(len(cost) - 4, -1, -1):
            cost[i] += min(cost[i + 1], cost[i + 2])
        return min(cost[0], cost[1])
```
