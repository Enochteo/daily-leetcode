## Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
This solution reconstructs a binary tree given its preorder and inorder traversal arrays. The key idea is to use the properties of traversal orders to recursively build the tree.

**Understand**
You are given two integer arrays: preorder and inorder, which represent the preorder and inorder traversal of a binary tree. Your task is to reconstruct the original binary tree and return its root.

Preorder traversal visits nodes in the order: Root -> Left -> Right

Inorder traversal visits nodes in the order: Left -> Root -> Right

The first element in the preorder array is always the root. Using this, you can find the left and right subtrees from the inorder array.

**Match**
This problem uses the Tree Reconstruction from Traversals pattern:

Recursive tree construction using traversal index information.

Subarray slicing to isolate left and right subtrees.

**Plan**
Base case: if either preorder or inorder is empty, return None.

Take the first value of preorder as the root value.

Find the index of that root value in the inorder array to divide the tree into left and right subtrees.

Recursively build the left subtree from the next mid elements in preorder and from the left part of inorder.

Recursively build the right subtree from the remaining part of both arrays.

Return the constructed root node
