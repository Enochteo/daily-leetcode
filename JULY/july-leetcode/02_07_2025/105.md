## Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
This solution reconstructs a binary tree given its preorder and inorder traversal arrays. The key idea is to use the properties of traversal orders to recursively build the tree.

**Understand**
You are given two integer arrays: preorder and inorder, which represent the preorder and inorder traversal of a binary tree. Your task is to reconstruct the original binary tree and return its root.

Preorder traversal visits nodes in the order: Root -> Left -> Right

Inorder traversal visits nodes in the order: Left -> Root -> Right

The first element in the preorder array is always the root. Using this, you can find the left and right subtrees from the inorder array.
