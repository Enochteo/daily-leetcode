## Elimination Game
You are given a list of integers from 1 to n in increasing order. You repeatedly eliminate every other number, alternating the direction (left to right, then right to left), until only one number remains. Return that number.

**Understand**
Weâ€™re simulating a process:

Start with numbers 1 to n.

In the first round, remove every other number from left to right.

In the next round, remove every other number from right to left.

Continue alternating until one number remains.

Goal: Return the last remaining number.

**Match**
This problem resembles:

A simulation problem that benefits from a mathematical/iterative reduction instead of simulating the full list.

We maintain the first element (head), step size, and direction to track how the list is evolving.

**Plan**
Initialize head = 1, representing the current starting element.

Set step = 1 to represent the distance between remaining numbers.

Use a boolean left_to_right to keep track of direction.

In each round:

If moving left to right, always update the head.

If moving right to left, update the head only if n is odd (the head gets removed otherwise).

Double the step size and halve n each round.

Flip the direction.

Repeat until n == 1, then return the head.
