## Delete Node in a Binary Search Tree
This solution removes a node with a specific key from a Binary Search Tree (BST). The logic handles all deletion scenarios: deleting a leaf, a node with one child, or a node with two children (by replacing it with its in-order successor). The recursive approach ensures BST properties are maintained.

**Understand**
Given a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key and return the new root. A BST maintains the property that for any node:

all nodes in the left subtree are less than the node,

all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the node.

Deletion scenarios:

Node has no children → remove it directly.

Node has one child → replace it with the child.

Node has two children → replace with in-order successor (smallest node in the right subtree).

**Match**
This problem fits the BST recursion pattern involving:

Tree traversal

Recursive updates

In-order successor retrieval

**Plan**
Traverse the tree recursively to find the node with the target key.

If found:

If it's a leaf node: return None.

If it has one child: return that child.

If it has two children:

Find the in-order successor (leftmost node in right subtree).

Replace current node's value with that successor’s value.

Recursively delete the successor from the right subtree.

Recursively update left/right subtrees as needed and return the root.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def deleteNode(self, root, key):
        if not root:
            return

        def min_right_sub_tree(root):
            while root.left:
                root = root.left
            return root

        if root.val == key:
            if not root.left and not root.right:
                return None
            elif not root.right:
                return root.left
            elif not root.left:
                return root.right
            else:
                new_root = min_right_sub_tree(root.right)
                root.val = new_root.val
                root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, new_root.val)
        elif root.val > key:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        else:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
        return root
