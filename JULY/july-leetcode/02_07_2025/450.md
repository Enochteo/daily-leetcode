## Delete Node in a Binary Search Tree
This solution removes a node with a specific key from a Binary Search Tree (BST). The logic handles all deletion scenarios: deleting a leaf, a node with one child, or a node with two children (by replacing it with its in-order successor). The recursive approach ensures BST properties are maintained.

**Understand**
Given a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key and return the new root. A BST maintains the property that for any node:

all nodes in the left subtree are less than the node,

all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the node.

Deletion scenarios:

Node has no children → remove it directly.

Node has one child → replace it with the child.

Node has two children → replace with in-order successor (smallest node in the right subtree).
