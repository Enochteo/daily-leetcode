## Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
**Understand**
Given a list of characters sorted in non-decreasing order, and a target character, return the smallest character in the list that is strictly greater than target.
The list wraps around, so if target is 'z', return the first letter in the list.

Example:

text
Copy
Edit
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"  
Output: "c"

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "j"  
Output: "c"

**Match**
This is a:

Binary Search problem

Circular sorted list

Similar to:

Lower bound search

"First greater element" logic

**Plan**
Use binary search to track the smallest character that is strictly greater than the target.

Use a recursive binary search helper.

Keep a candidate variable to store the current best answer.

If letters[mid] > target, store letters[mid] and move left.

If letters[mid] <= target, move right.

After search, return candidate if found, otherwise return letters[0] (wrap-around).
