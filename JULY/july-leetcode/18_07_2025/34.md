##  Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
**Understand**
Given a sorted array nums, return the starting and ending position of a given target value.
If not found, return [-1, -1].

Example:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3, 4]

**Match**
This is a:

Binary Search variation

Classic range-finding problem in sorted arrays

Similar to:

LeetCode 704 (Binary Search)

Lower and upper bound problems

**Plan**
Write a helper function start(l, r) to:

Perform binary search to find the first occurrence of target

Return index where nums[mid] == target and either:

mid == 0, or

nums[mid - 1] < target

Write another helper function end(l, r) to:

Find the last occurrence

Return index where nums[mid] == target and either:

mid == len(nums) - 1, or

nums[mid + 1] > target

Return both results as [start(...), end(...)]
