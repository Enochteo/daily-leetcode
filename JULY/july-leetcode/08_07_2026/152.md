## Maximum Product Subarray
**Understand**
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

**Match**
Dynamic Programming with State Tracking

Track both maximum and minimum products due to the sign-flipping behavior of negative numbers.

**Plan**
Initialize res with the max of nums to handle single-element arrays.

Track two values:

currentMax: the max product ending at current index

currentMin: the min product ending at current index

Iterate through nums, and for each element:

If n == 0, reset currentMin and currentMax to 1.

Temporarily store n * currentMax.

Update currentMax as the maximum of n, n * currentMax, and n * currentMin.

Update currentMin similarly for the minimum.

Update the result (res) with the max of currentMax.
