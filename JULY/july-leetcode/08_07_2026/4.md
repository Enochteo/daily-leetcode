## Median of Two Sorted Arrays
**Understand**
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, return the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(min(n, m))), but this solution has the brute force solution of O(log(m+n)).

**Match**
Basic merging + median finding logic

Brute-force approach using sort after merging

Not the optimal binary search method required by the problem constraints
