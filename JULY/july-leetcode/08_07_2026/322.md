## Coin Change
**Understand**
You are given a list of coin denominations and a target amount. You need to return the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount. If it's not possible, return -1.

**Match**
Dynamic Programming â€“ Bottom-Up Approach

Unbounded knapsack pattern

We're minimizing the number of elements (coins) used to reach a target sum.

**Plan**
Initialize a DP array dp of size amount + 1 with values set to amount + 1 (infinity placeholder).

Set dp[0] = 0 since 0 coins are needed to make 0 amount.

For each amount from 1 to amount, try every coin:

If i - coin >= 0, update dp[i] using the recurrence:
dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - coin])

Return dp[amount] if it's not equal to the placeholder; otherwise, return -1.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
        dp = [amount+1] * (amount+1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            for c in coins:
                if i - c >= 0:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - c])
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != amount + 1 else -1
```
