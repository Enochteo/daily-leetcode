##  Binary Tree Paths
**Understand**
Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths as strings with "->" between node values.

**Match**
Problem Type: Backtracking / DFS

Input: Binary tree

Output: List of strings representing root to leaf paths.

**Plan**
Use DFS with backtracking to explore all paths.

When reaching a leaf node, append the current path to the result.

Recursively add current node value and "->" during the traversal.

**Implement**
Base case: return if node is null.

If node is a leaf, build the full path string and append to result.

Otherwise, update the path and continue DFS left and right.

**Review**
path[:] ensures path string is not modified across branches.

Efficient for small-to-medium trees.

Avoids global variables by passing strings down the call stack.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n), visiting each node once

Space Complexity: O(h) recursion stack, where h is tree height

**Pattern to remember by:**
DFS with backtracking to collect all root-to-leaf paths as strings
