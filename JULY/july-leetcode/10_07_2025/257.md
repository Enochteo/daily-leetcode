##  Binary Tree Paths
**Understand**
Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths as strings with "->" between node values.

**Match**
Problem Type: Backtracking / DFS

Input: Binary tree

Output: List of strings representing root to leaf paths.

**Plan**
Use DFS with backtracking to explore all paths.

When reaching a leaf node, append the current path to the result.

Recursively add current node value and "->" during the traversal.
