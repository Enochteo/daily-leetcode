## Permutations
**Understand**
Return all possible permutations of a list of distinct integers.
The permutations would be of length n! where n is the length of the list.

**Match**
Problem Type: Backtracking / Divide and Conquer

Output: All permutations â†’ full traversal of recursive tree

**Plan**

If nums is empty, return [[]].

Use a helper recurse(index):

If index == len(nums), append a copy of nums to results.

Otherwise, for each i from index to len(nums)-1:

Swap nums[i] with nums[index], recurse on index+1, then swap back.

Start with recurse(0) and return res.
