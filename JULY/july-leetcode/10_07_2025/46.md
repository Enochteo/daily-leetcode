## Permutations
**Understand**
Return all possible permutations of a list of distinct integers.
The permutations would be of length n! where n is the length of the list.

**Match**
Problem Type: Backtracking / Divide and Conquer

Output: All permutations → full traversal of recursive tree

**Plan**
Use recursion to build permutations:

Base case: If nums is empty, return [[]]

Recursive case:

Get all permutations of nums[1:]

Insert the first element into every position in each permutation

**Implement**
Recurse on the list without the first element.

For each permutation of the smaller list, insert the first element in all positions.

Accumulate the results.

**Review**
Recursive insert-based strategy is clear and works well for unique elements.

Space complexity grows factorially as expected for permutations.

This avoids using used arrays or explicit backtracking paths.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(n!) – total number of permutations

Space Complexity: O(n!) for result list
