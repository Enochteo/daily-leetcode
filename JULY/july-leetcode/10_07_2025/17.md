## Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
**Understand**
Given a string of digits from 2–9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent (like on a telephone keypad).

**Match**
Problem Type: DFS / Backtracking

Input: A string of digits (2–9)

Output: All letter combinations the number could represent

**Plan**
Use a digit-to-letter mapping for each number (like a keypad).

Apply DFS to explore all combinations:

At each level, choose a letter for the current digit.

Append it to a partial combination.

Recursively go deeper until the full string is built.

**Implement**
Base case: if combination length equals digits length, append to result.

Use recursion with current index and accumulated string.

Skip processing if input is empty.

**Review**
The digit mapping starts at 2 (so index is digit - 2).

Empty input returns an empty list.

DFS builds combinations in a tree-like manner.
