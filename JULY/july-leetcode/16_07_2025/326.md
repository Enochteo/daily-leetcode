## Power of Three
**Understand**
You're given an integer n.

Goal:
Return True if n is a power of 3, else return False.

Examples:

27 → True (3^3)

0 → False

9 → True

45 → False

**Match**
This problem matches:

Recursion (repeated division)

Loop or log-based checks

Can also be done via mathematical bounds

**Plan**
Base case: If n == 1, it's 3^0, so return True.

If n < 1, it cannot be a power of 3, return False.

Recursively divide n by 3.

If at any point n / 3 is not a whole number, return False.
