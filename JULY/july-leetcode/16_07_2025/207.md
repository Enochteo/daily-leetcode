## Course Schedule
**Understand**
You are given:

numCourses total number of courses (labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1)

prerequisites, a list of pairs [a, b] meaning you must take course b before a.

Goal:
Return True if it's possible to finish all courses (i.e., no cyclic dependencies), otherwise False.

**Match**
This is a classic cycle detection problem in a directed graph:

Courses are nodes.

Prerequisites form directed edges.

A cycle means you can't complete all courses.

Matching Patterns:

Directed Graph Cycle Detection

DFS with visited and recursion path tracking
