## Course Schedule
**Understand**
You are given:

numCourses total number of courses (labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1)

prerequisites, a list of pairs [a, b] meaning you must take course b before a.

Goal:
Return True if it's possible to finish all courses (i.e., no cyclic dependencies), otherwise False.

**Match**
This is a classic cycle detection problem in a directed graph:

Courses are nodes.

Prerequisites form directed edges.

A cycle means you can't complete all courses.

Matching Patterns:

Directed Graph Cycle Detection

DFS with visited and recursion path tracking

**Plan**
Build an adjacency list graph from prerequisites.

For each course (node), run DFS to detect if there's a cycle:

Use a path set to track the recursion stack.

Use a visited set to mark fully processed nodes.

If DFS detects a cycle, return False.

If all nodes pass, return True.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        """
        :type numCourses: int
        :type prerequisites: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        visited = set()
        path = set()
        
        def dfs(node):
            if node in path:
                return False  # cycle detected
            if node in visited:
                return True  # already processed

            path.add(node)
            for prereq in graph[node]:
                if not dfs(prereq):
                    return False
            path.remove(node)
            visited.add(node)
            return True

        # Build graph
        graph = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}
        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            graph[course].append(prereq)
        
        # Check for cycles
        for c in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(c):
                return False
        return True
```
**Review**
Correct use of DFS with path (for current stack) and visited (for global memoization).

Avoids rechecking processed nodes.

Graph constructed cleanly.

**Evaluate**
Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Each course and edge is processed once.

Space Complexity: O(V + E)
Adjacency list + recursion stack (path) + visited sets.

**Pattern to Remember By**
When checking for cycles in a directed graph, use DFS with a visited set for completed nodes and a path set for the current recursion stack to detect back edges (i.e., cycles).
