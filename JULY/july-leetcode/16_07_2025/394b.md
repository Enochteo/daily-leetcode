##  Decode String
**Understand**
You're given an encoded string s, where:

A number followed by square brackets encloses a substring that should be repeated, e.g., "3[a]" becomes "aaa".

Nested encodings are allowed, e.g., "3[a2[c]]" becomes "accaccacc".

Goal: Return the fully decoded string.

**Match**
Classic stack-based decoding problem.

Similar to:

Valid Parentheses (bracket matching)

Evaluate Expressions (store state)

Decode Nested Strings

**Plan**
Use a stack to store the context of the string and repeat count before entering a new bracketed section:

Iterate through the string s.

If the character is a digit, build the full number (curr_no).

If the character is '[', push the current string and repeat count to the stack, then reset for a new section.
