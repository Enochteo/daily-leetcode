##  Decode String
**Understand**
You're given an encoded string s, where:

A number followed by square brackets encloses a substring that should be repeated, e.g., "3[a]" becomes "aaa".

Nested encodings are allowed, e.g., "3[a2[c]]" becomes "accaccacc".

Goal: Return the fully decoded string.

**Match**
Classic stack-based decoding problem.

Similar to:

Valid Parentheses (bracket matching)

Evaluate Expressions (store state)

Decode Nested Strings

**Plan**
Use a stack to store the context of the string and repeat count before entering a new bracketed section:

Iterate through the string s.

If the character is a digit, build the full number (curr_no).

If the character is '[', push the current string and repeat count to the stack, then reset for a new section.

If the character is ']', pop from the stack and append the repeated decoded string to the outer context.

If it's a letter, append to the current working string curr_str.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def decodeString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        stack = []
        curr_no, curr_str = 0, ""
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i].isdigit():
                curr_no = curr_no * 10 + int(s[i])
            elif s[i] == "[":
                stack.append([curr_str, curr_no])
                curr_str = ""
                curr_no = 0
            elif s[i] == "]":
                prev_str, num = stack.pop()
                curr_str = prev_str + curr_str * num
            else:
                curr_str += s[i]
        return curr_str
```
