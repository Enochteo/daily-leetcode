## Decode String
**Understand**
You're given an encoded string s with the following format:

A number followed by a bracketed substring means repetition, e.g., "3[a]" → "aaa".

Substrings can be nested: "3[a2[c]]" → "accaccacc"

Goal:
Return the decoded string.

**Match**
This is a stack or recursion problem.

You encounter characters in sequence and must handle:

Digits → multiplier

[ → start of a new recursive substring

] → end of current recursive substring

Letters → add to result

**Plan**
Use a recursive helper function to:

Initialize res as the current decoded string.

Iterate through s using index:

If a digit is encountered, build the full number (could be >1 digit).

After digit, skip [ and call helper(index) recursively.

Multiply returned substring by num and append to res.

If ] is encountered, return the current res and updated index.

Else, it's a letter – just append to res.

At the end, return the final decoded string from index 0.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def decodeString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        def helper(index):
            res = ""
            while index < len(s):
                if s[index].isdigit():
                    num = 0
                    while index < len(s) and s[index].isdigit():
                        num = num * 10 + int(s[index])
                        index += 1
                    index += 1  # skip '['
                    substring, index = helper(index)
                    res += substring * num
                elif s[index] == "]":
                    return res, index + 1
                else:
                    res += s[index]
                    index += 1
            return res, index
        
        result, _ = helper(0)
        return result
```
