## Decode String
**Understand**
You're given an encoded string s with the following format:

A number followed by a bracketed substring means repetition, e.g., "3[a]" → "aaa".

Substrings can be nested: "3[a2[c]]" → "accaccacc"

Goal:
Return the decoded string.

**Match**
This is a stack or recursion problem.

You encounter characters in sequence and must handle:

Digits → multiplier

[ → start of a new recursive substring

] → end of current recursive substring

Letters → add to result

**Plan**
Use a recursive helper function to:

Initialize res as the current decoded string.

Iterate through s using index:

If a digit is encountered, build the full number (could be >1 digit).

After digit, skip [ and call helper(index) recursively.

Multiply returned substring by num and append to res.

If ] is encountered, return the current res and updated index.

Else, it's a letter – just append to res.

At the end, return the final decoded string from index 0.
