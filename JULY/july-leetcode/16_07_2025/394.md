## Decode String
**Understand**
You're given an encoded string s with the following format:

A number followed by a bracketed substring means repetition, e.g., "3[a]" → "aaa".

Substrings can be nested: "3[a2[c]]" → "accaccacc"

Goal:
Return the decoded string.

**Match**
This is a stack or recursion problem.

You encounter characters in sequence and must handle:

Digits → multiplier

[ → start of a new recursive substring

] → end of current recursive substring

Letters → add to result
