## Last Stone Weight
**Understand**
You are given a list of stone weights. Each turn, smash the two heaviest stones:

If equal, both are destroyed.

If not, the heavier becomes heavier - lighter and is put back.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone (or 0 if none remain).

**Match**
Repeatedly retrieving the two largest elements -> Max-Heap

Python has only min-heap -> we simulate max-heap by negating values

**Plan**
Convert all elements to negative to simulate a max-heap.

Heapify the list.

While more than one stone:

Pop the two largest stones.

If theyâ€™re unequal, push the difference back into the heap.

Return the absolute value of the last element (or 0 if empty).

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones):
        for i in range(len(stones)):
            stones[i] = -stones[i]
        heapq.heapify(stones)
        while len(stones) > 1:
            smash1 = heapq.heappop(stones)
            smash2 = heapq.heappop(stones)
            heapq.heappush(stones, smash1 - smash2)
        return abs(stones[0])
```
**Review**
Correctly simulates a max-heap using a min-heap

Handles empty or one-element edge cases naturally
