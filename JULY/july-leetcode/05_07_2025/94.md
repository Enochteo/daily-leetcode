## Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
Review question: traversal with iterative approach
**Understand**
Perform an inorder traversal of a binary tree without recursion.
Inorder traversal means: left → root → right

Input: Root of a binary tree
Output: List of node values in inorder

**Match**
Iterative tree traversal

Use a stack to simulate the recursion

Suitable for trees where recursion may cause stack overflow

**Plan**
Initialize an empty stack and result list.

While there’s a node to process:

Traverse left as deep as possible, pushing nodes to the stack.

Pop from the stack, process the node (add to result).

Move to its right child.

Continue until both stack and current are empty.
