## K Closest Points to Origin
**Understand**
You're given a list of 2D points and an integer k. Return the k closest points to the origin (0,0) based on Euclidean distance.

Distance is computed as: distance = x² + y²
(No need to compute the square root since it's monotonic.)

**Match**
Top-K pattern

Heap (priority queue) approach

We can use a min-heap based on the squared distance

**Plan**
Convert each point to a tuple: (distance, x, y)

Build a min-heap from these tuples.

Pop the heap k times to get the k closest points.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def kClosest(self, points, k):
        res = []
        heap = []
        for x, y in points:
            heap.append([(x**2 + y**2), x, y])
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        while k > 0:
            dist, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
            res.append([x, y])
            k -= 1
        return res
```

**Review**
Builds the heap in O(n)

Pops k elements in O(k log n)
