## Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children
**Understand**
You are given:

candies: list of piles, where each candies[i] is the number of candies in the i-th pile.

k: number of children.

Each child must receive the same number of candies, taken from any pile. Return the maximum number of candies each child can receive without breaking this rule.

**Example**:
Input: candies = [5,8,6], k = 3  
Output: 5  
Explanation: You can give 5 to one child (from 5), and 6 to two other children (from 8 and 6), each gets 5.

**Match**
Binary Search on answer

Monotonic condition: the more candies you try to give per child, the fewer total children can be satisfied.

**Plan**
Initialize binary search range from 1 to max(candies).

For each guess mid, compute how many children can be satisfied using:

sum(pile // mid for pile in candies)
If children >= k, we can potentially give more. Store mid in result and search higher.

Else, reduce r.

**Implement**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maximumCandies(self, candies, k):
        l = 1
        r = max(candies)
        result = 0
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            children = sum(pile // mid for pile in candies)
            if children >= k:
                result = mid
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1
        return result
```
