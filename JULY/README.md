## Daily Leetcode Practice
This repo contains my daily leetcode solution bank as well as UMPIRE approach used to come across this solutions. I am using this space to sharpen my problem-solving skills, improve coding efficiency and prepare for technical interviews.

### Goals
- Practice data structures and algorithms consistently.
- Build a strong foundation for coding assessments.
- Track my progress over time.

It's a new month... new beginings, but the same ol daily grind.
This month I would be focusing moderately on practice and furnishing my problem solving, and then I would also be moving to the more complex concepts(or better say concepts I don't really know yet):
- Heaps/Priority queue
- Graphs
- Bit  
- Backtracking

I would also language-cross and practice my C++ skills by solving questions in this beautiful language.
