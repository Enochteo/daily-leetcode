## Min Stack

**Understand**

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element — all in constant time.

Methods:

push(val) → insert an element onto the stack.

pop() → remove the top element.

top() → return the top element.

getMin() → return the smallest element in the stack.

[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

**Match**
This is a stack design pattern problem with an auxiliary data structure to maintain the minimum efficiently.

Key idea:

Maintain two stacks:

stack: stores all values.

minStack: stores current minimums (only updated when a new min is pushed or popped).

Thus, the top of minStack always gives the minimum so far.
