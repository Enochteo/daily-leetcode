## Reverse Integer

**Understand**

Given a 32-bit signed integer x, return its digits reversed.
If reversing causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2³¹, 2³¹ − 1], return 0.

**Match**

This problem tests integer manipulation and overflow detection.
The main challenge: reverse digits mathematically (without converting to string) and ensure the result fits in 32-bit range.

Pattern: Extract digits with modulus and rebuild in reverse order.
