## Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank

**Understand**

Every Monday, the deposit starts with an incremented base amount — starting from 1 dollar in week 1, then 2 in week 2, etc.
Each subsequent day of the week adds +1 dollar compared to the previous day.

You must return the total money deposited after n days.

Example:
Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation:
Week 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28
Week 2 (3 days): 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
Total = 28 + 9 = 37

**Match**

This problem can be modeled as repeated arithmetic progressions:

Each week forms a 7-day arithmetic series.

The first term (a₁) = week number.

The last term (aₙ) = a₁ + 6.

The number of terms = 7 (or fewer for the final partial week).

Use the arithmetic sum formula:

**Plan**

Initialize:

res = 0 (total money)

starting_amt = 1 (first Monday deposit)

While n > 0:

Compute the number of days this week: days = min(7, n)

Add sum of this week using the formula:

res += (days / 2) _ ((2 _ starting_amt) + (days - 1))

Subtract 7 from n

Increment starting_amt for next week

Return int(res) (convert float to int for precision).

**Implement**

```py
class Solution:
    def totalMoney(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        starting_amt = 1
        while n > 0:
            days = min(n, 7)
            res += (days / 2) * ((2 * starting_amt) + (days - 1))
            n -= 7
            starting_amt += 1
        return int(res)
```

**Review**

Uses arithmetic progression to avoid explicit looping over each day.
Efficient for large n (no nested loops).
Handles partial weeks cleanly using min(n, 7).

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: O(n / 7) → effectively O(1) since n ≤ 1000

Space Complexity: O(1)

Edge Cases:

n = 1 → 1

n = 7 → 28

n = 10 → 37

**Pattern to Remember**

This problem illustrates the Arithmetic Progression Pattern:
Use series formulas to replace cumulative iteration logic — common in problems involving daily/weekly increments or repeated growth rates.
