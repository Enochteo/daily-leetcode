## Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram

**Understand**

You are given two strings s and t of the same length.
Return the minimum number of steps required to make t an anagram of s.

A step consists of replacing one character in t.

Example 1:

Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"  
Output: 1
Explanation:
Replace the first 'a' in t with 'b' → "bab" (now anagram of s)

**Match**

This is an anagram difference counting problem.
We need to find how many characters are extra or missing in t compared to s.

The efficient way:

Use a frequency array of length 26 (for lowercase letters).

Count characters in s (+1)

Reduce counts for matching characters in t (−1 when possible).

The remaining positive counts represent replacements needed in t.

Plan

Initialize a frequency array freq[26] to 0.

For each character c in s, increment its frequency index.

For each character c in t, if frequency is positive, decrement it (matched character).

The sum of remaining positive frequencies = number of replacements needed.

**Implement**

```py
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        freq = [0] * 26
        for c in s:
            freq[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1

        for c in t:
            if freq[ord(c) - ord('a')]:
                freq[ord(c) - ord('a')] -= 1

        return sum(freq)
```

**Review**

Simple O(n) linear pass.
Constant space O(26) → effectively O(1).
Works for any lowercase strings of equal length.

**Evaluate**

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1) (fixed-size frequency array).

Handles duplicates, large input, and equal-length guarantee correctly.
