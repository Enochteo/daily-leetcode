## Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram

**Understand**

You are given two strings s and t of the same length.
Return the minimum number of steps required to make t an anagram of s.

A step consists of replacing one character in t.

Example 1:

Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"  
Output: 1
Explanation:
Replace the first 'a' in t with 'b' → "bab" (now anagram of s)

**Match**

This is an anagram difference counting problem.
We need to find how many characters are extra or missing in t compared to s.

The efficient way:

Use a frequency array of length 26 (for lowercase letters).

Count characters in s (+1)

Reduce counts for matching characters in t (−1 when possible).

The remaining positive counts represent replacements needed in t.
