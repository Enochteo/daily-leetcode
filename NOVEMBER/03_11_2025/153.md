## Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

**Understand**

You are given a rotated sorted array of unique elements.
Return the minimum element of the array.

The array was originally sorted in ascending order but then rotated at some pivot.
You must find the minimum in O(log n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Rotated at index 3 → [1,2,3,4,5]
