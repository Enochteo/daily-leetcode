## Max Alternating Sum of Squared Symmetric Pairs

**Understand**

Given an integer list nums, the algorithm computes an alternating difference of squared terms using symmetric elements from both ends after sorting by absolute value.

The final result adds the square of right-side values and subtracts the square of left-side values, moving inward until the two pointers meet.
If one element remains (when l == r), its square is added.

Example:

Input: nums = [1, -3, 2, 4]
Sorted by abs: [1, 2, -3, 4]
Right: add 4² + (-3)² = 16 + 9
Left: subtract 1² + 2² = 1 + 4
Result: (16 + 9) - (1 + 4) = 20

**Match**

This resembles a two-pointer accumulation pattern, often used for problems where symmetric or opposing ends are processed simultaneously.

Key idea:

Sort array by absolute value.

Use left (l) and right (r) pointers.

At each step:

Add nums[r]²

Subtract nums[l]²

Move inward until l >= r.
