## Array Partition I

**Understand**

You are given an array of 2n integers.
You must pair the integers into n pairs such that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

Example:

Input: nums = [1, 4, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Pairs = (1, 2), (3, 4)
Sum of mins = 1 + 3 = 4

Goal:
Form pairs (a, b) from the sorted array to maximize the sum of min(a, b) for each pair.

**Match**

This is a greedy problem:

Sorting ensures that adjacent elements form the most balanced pairs.

The smaller element in each pair (at even indices after sorting) contributes to the optimal total.

Key idea:
When sorted, pairing adjacent numbers ensures no large number "wastes" a small partner — maximizing the sum of the minimums.

This is known as the Sorted Pairing Greedy Pattern.

**Plan**

Sort the array in ascending order.

Initialize sum_of_pairs = 0.

Iterate over every second element (index 0, 2, 4, …):

Add nums[i] to sum_of_pairs (the smaller element in each sorted pair).

Return sum_of_pairs.

**Implement**

```py
class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        sum_of_pairs = 0
        i, j = 0, 1
        while j < len(nums):
            sum_of_pairs += nums[i]
            i += 2
            j += 2
        return sum_of_pairs
```

**Simplified Pythonic version:**

```py
class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return sum(nums[::2])
```

**Review**

Correctness: Sorting guarantees optimal pairing.
Efficiency: Minimal computation after sorting.
Clarity: Straightforward logic and easy to understand.

**Evaluate**
Metric Analysis
Time Complexity O(N log N) — due to sorting
Space Complexity O(1) — in-place sort
Approach Greedy + Sorting
Edge Cases Negative numbers, duplicate values, minimum size (n=1)

**Pattern to Remember**

This follows the Greedy Pairing Pattern —
When asked to maximize the sum of minimums or minimize the sum of maximums in pairs,
sort the array and pick elements in alternating positions (even indices for min-sum, odd for max-sum).
